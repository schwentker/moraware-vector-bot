      "content": "Video: CounterGo Quick Start Guide VIDEO LINKS: Price Lists Video: Use Metric Settings & Price Lists Convert Slab Cost To Square Foot Price Convert Slab Cost To Square Meters TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to the CounterGo Quick Start Guide. This video will introduce you to how CounterGo works, how to get started, and where to find answers if you have questions, so you can start quoting right away. The quickest way to learn CounterGo is to start making Quotes.It doesn't matter if you use real or practice info. You always have the option to delete practice Quotes later. Creating Quotes will help you understand the fundamentals. Then you can decide how to tailor CounterGo to your specific needs. There are three main topics. This video will cover.First, we'll look at Price Lists. This is where Quotes get the numbers to calculate Quote totals. Next, we'll set up a Quote Form, which you'll need to print or email Quotes to your customers.Finally, we'll draw a quick Quote.Let's take a look at the Price List so you know where to find it and what it contains. When you're making your first Quotes, you don't need to have the Price List filled in.Any Quote can be manually updated in Step Six, so don't worry about filling in every item right away. From the left hand menu, click on Price List. Notice that one list is already enabled. Each CounterGo, Quote, can only pull from one Price List at a time, even if you have multiple Price Lists.Price Lists are independent of each other, so each one must be updated manually if you need to make changes.We recommend adding all of your pricing into one list to start. You can apply discounts, set up automatic Account discounts, or manually adjust prices in Step Six.Once you complete one Price List, duplicate it, and make changes. This will save time, if you do need to create and manage more than one Price List. If you work in metric, pause this video and watch the Price Lists Video: Use Metric Settings & Price Lists before continuing.There's a link to it below this video.Click on Retail, then Edit Price List. Now click on Materials. This is where you're going to enter all of the Materials you use in your business. Your database already has some default Materials loaded.Click Delete Material to remove any you don't use. Click Add Material at the top to enter new products. From the dropdown menu, you'll see a list of Material available to add.If a Material you use is not listed, choose Add Custom Material instead. Type in all of the information, then add Colors for that product, one name per line. Set the default Slab Size. You can change this in individual Quotes or for particular Colors later. By default, Allow Other Color, Allow Discount, and Editable Price On Quote are checked.These options allow you to add a one-time Other Color manually in a Quote, apply discounts to this Material, or manually adjust the price in Step Six of a Quote. We recommend leaving them checked as you begin. You always have the option to come back to the Price List and change these options later.There are some default Colors loaded. Add or delete Colors, just be sure there's only one name per line.Let's talk pricing. CounterGo can price by the Slab square footage or by the countertop square footage. If pricing by the entire Slab, you'll want to change your Colors to be priced by the Slab.Calculate the price per square foot for the total Slab and enter that number. If pricing by the countertop square footage, then leave as is and enter the price you charge. There's a helpful article, Convert Slab Costs To Square Foot Price, or Convert Slab Costs To Square Meter Price, in our knowledge base if you need tips calculating Slab pricing. Those articles are also linked below this video.In each Material. You can also create Price Groups to group Colors together and apply a price to all of the Colors within the group at one time. Using Price Groups is a quick way to update your pricing. Let's move to Fabrication and Installation.If you have separate Installation and Fabrication charges, enable Installation here in order for that charge to appear when Quoting. Add your retail price for Fabrication and or Installation in the boxes. Specific Fabrication and Installation charges can be added for specific Materials. We have step-by-step info on that in the knowledge base.For now, you can edit the price manually in Step Six, as long as Editable Price On Quote is checked.All right, we've got our Material, Fabrication, and Installation set. Those are the essentials. Go through the remainder of the Price List when you can, and add in your prices. If there are things you don't charge for, enter zero. Before you exit, make sure to save or all your changes will be lost. Time to set up a Quote Form. You'll use Quote Forms to print or email Quotes to your customers, and there's lots of ways to customize them. Head over to Settings, Quote & Order, then Forms. There are a few default Templates provided. Let's begin with the Form Template call",

Welcome to the first video in the CounterGo Getting Started series. Log in to your CounterGo database. It will be a link like yourcompanyname.moraware.net. Lots of folks get stuck at first because they use “.com” instead of “.net”. Taking a look at the home page, you’ll see there are options along the left side and across the top. They will change slightly depending on where you are in your database. The left side navigation gets you to different places within your database. The top menu bar has icons for what actions you can perform relative to where you are. Hover over an icon, you’ll see a pop-up definition of that icon. Click on this icon to Create a Quote! You can make Quotes Standalone or organize them in Accounts. Check out our OnlineHelpCenter for more on creating and using Accounts. For this first Quote, let’s make it a Standalone. Finish creating your first Quote by clicking Save. Notice you’re now in Steps 1-6 of creating a Quote. You can go through in order or skip around. Different steps have different functions, not every function appears in every step. To draw a counter, click, hold and drag, it’s that easy. The next video in this series will dive into Steps 1-4 in more detail. Let’s save this Quote as is to take a look at some non-drawing Quote areas. From the top menubar click on the Save icon.

      "content": "Get Started Video 2: Drawing Your Countertops OBJECTIVES Draw & Modify Shapes Annotate Drawings Edge & Splash Add Sinks And Sink & Cooktop Cutouts TRANSCRIPT: Hi, this is Evan from Moraware! Welcome to Drawing Your Countertops. Log in to your CounterGo database. Start a new Quote or open an existing one. To create your countertop pieces, click, hold, and drag your cursor in the blank canvas area. Let’s draw an L-shaped piece, a smaller piece, and an island. Resize a countertop by clicking and holding on an edge to move it. Or, click on the dimension and enter the exact number. If you click Save & Next Edge, you can enter all the dimensions for this piece in this one box. Move pieces around by clicking and holding inside the shape and move to the position you want. Click once on any piece to Rotate, Duplicate, or Delete the Counter. Let’s add some text to this Quote to label that a stove slides into this space. From the right side navigation click the Text box, then, click anywhere in the Drawing space and enter the text to display. Click and hold on the Text to move it. Click once, for a menu to Edit, Duplicate, or make the text Larger or Smaller. Let’s move to Step2 Curves & Bumpouts to modify corners and counter pieces. All corners are abbreviated “Standard”. CounterGo assumes every corner is standard, or square, unless you tell it otherwise. Click on any corner for a submenu of options to apply. The options will vary slightly depending on if you are clicking on an inside or outside corner. Click on a counter edge for a pop-up menu of options to select. Add a bump-in along the inside edge of the L-shaped counter. Click on the edge and select Add Bump-In from the menu. Enter the Depth and Width and select squared, or angled edges. Position the Bump-in in the Center of the counter, or offset it from the Left or Right. Moving to the island, let’s give one edge a Full Radius. To change any of the corners or shaping features, click on the corner or feature dimension, select the current dimension, and make your edit. Time to add some Splashes and designate which Edges are finished. Click on Step 3. All the edges are marked “F”. CounterGo assumes every edge is finished unless you tell it otherwise. Here in Step 3, you’ll only be indicating if an edge is finished, unfinished, or a flat cut and polish. Later in Step 5, you’ll designate which finished edge should be applied. Click on a side edge and select Unfinished. The edges on either side of the slide-in stove will have a flat cut and polish, which we call an Appliance edge in CounterGo. If you’re wondering what AdditionalFinishedEdge is for, it is part of a two-step process to add more than one kind of edge finish to a countertop. Check out the Waterfall& Multiple Edges video to go through the steps in detail. Click on a counter edge that will have a Splash. Select from the presets or choose “Other Splash” to add a custom splash height. Click on another edge to add a Splash. In the pop-up menu, the splash height you applied most recently is at the top. Move to Step 4 to add Sink and Cooktopcutouts to your counters. Click on any countertop and note the new options. You can add a Sink Model, a Sink Cutout, or a Cooktop Cutout to display in the countertop. Click on the counter and select SinkCutout. Enter the type, shape, dimensions, and faucet count. If you select Show Centerline, you’ll see the distance from the left or right edge of the counter to the center of the sink. I want to show a centerline on this cutout, to help me position it properly. Click and hold on the sink to move it. The centerline dimension change accordingly. You can click on the centerline number to enter a precise offset. Click once on the sink for a menu to edit the properties, rotate, or delete the sink. If you add a Sink Model, the cutout will look the same, but CounterGo will add a line item for the price of the sink and the price of the cutout in Step 6. Time to add a CooktopCutout. Enter the dimensions, the number of burners and if you’d like to see a centerline for placement. Click and hold on the cutout to reposition. Click once on it for a menu to edit the Properties, or to rotate the cutout. There are lots of places to find Help as you are working, including when you are in the Drawing steps.

Welcome to Materials, Areas & Layout. Log in to your CounterGo database. Start a new Quote or open an existing one. Click on Step 5. You’ll be able to add in all your Materials, Colors, Edges, and pricing into your Price List later, but for now, make a selection from the drop-down menu. Choose a Material, a Color, and an Edge. By default, all your counter pieces will be put into one Area. If you’re quoting more than one area or using multiple materials in one Quote, you can divide the Quote up to show that. Click on “+ Counter Area” to add an additional Area in the Quote. Across from “Area # 2” is a small piece of paper with a pencil icon, the Edit icon. Click on it to rename this area something more meaningful, like “Island”. Look at the small thumbnail drawing for this new Area “Island”. Notice all the pieces are grey. Click on a piece and select to “Make this counter a member of Island” to add it to the Area. Every time you create a new CounterArea, you have to tell CounterGo which pieces belong in that Area. With countertops in different Areas, you can select different Materials, Colors, and Edges. Let’s make a few changes so that the Island is different than the Perimeter counters. We will use a one-time “Other Color” for this area. This feature lets you add a color to this Quote only, it will not add it to your Price List. In the Color drop-down, scroll to the bottom to find “Other Color”. Enter the color Name and the Price per square foot. Even if you are going to be pricing by the slab, you must enter a price per square foot. CounterGo will calculate the cost of the entire slab based on the number you enter. For this counter, I am going to price it by the square foot, so I'll uncheck Priced By The Slab. I'll leave Allow Discount checked in case I want to apply a discount in Step 6. We are ready to lay out our pieces on slabs and add slab images. Click on Perimeter Slab & Layout in the green bar, then check the Show Layout box. CounterGo will estimate how many slabs you need. Notice the pieces are stacked on top of one another. When all the pieces turn green, your layout is good to go. Yellow, Orange, and Red warn you when pieces are overlapping, off the slab, or both. Move counter pieces by clicking and holding your mouse on any piece. Click once on any piece to rotate pieces or define seams. Click on a large piece and select Define Seams. Move your mouse over the counter piece and click to place a seam. If you don’t like the placement, click on the delete icon to the right of that seam to remove it. Position all your pieces so that they are green. If you need to add an additional slab, click +Slab in the lower left corner. Time to add a slab image! Click on the slab dimensions to the right of the layout. This is where you can adjust the size of your slab, delete a slab, or click on Select Image to add an image to this slab. You will need to have slab images saved on your computer or in the cloud before you get to this step. Since your database is empty, click on +ImageFile then Choose to Upload. This will let you step through locations on your computer or cloud to find your image. Select the file then click Save. The green rectangle you see is the proportional representation of your slab. If you click and hold on an edge or corner you can resize the box to eliminate any unwanted areas in the image file. You can also click and hold to reposition the green box on the image. Click Save when you are ready to place the image. The image is placed on the slab and when you move your pieces, it will update in real-time. For the island slab, I’ll use an image I’ve uploaded before. Using the same steps, I’ll click on the slab dimensions, then Select Image, and now I’ll search for the image I used in another Quote since it is already saved in my database. Once you have added images to your database they are always in your database and you can search for them without having to upload them. I can reposition the image in the slab representation if I need to, and now all my pieces have a slab image.

Welcome to Pricing Your Quote. Log in to your CounterGo database. Start a new Quote or open an existing one. Click on Step 5 and be sure you have a Product, Color and Edge selected. If you haven’t made these selections, you won’t be able to edit in Step 6. CounterGo allows you to save all your pricing in PriceLists, but you can start Quoting before you get those set up. Let's manually into this Quote. Move to Step 6. There's a lot of red text indicating missing prices. Click on any underlined text to make changes. I'll click on “no price available” to manually enter a price. If you make a mistake or need to modify a price you enter, click on the underlined black text to update it. If there are line items that you don't charge for, enter zero. If you don’t enter zero CounterGo won’t be able to total your Quote, resulting in a warning that there are prices missing. There may be items you charge for that aren't listed. Let’s add a one-time Miscellaneous item to get one of those into the Quote. To the right of the Area name, you’ll see the Add Icon. Click on the drop-down menu and select Add Miscellaneous Item. This will add an item to this Quote only, it will not add it to the Price List. You'll be able to add miscellaneous items into your Price List later. E the name in Description field, the Quantity, Price and which Area to display the item. If you select one of the Areas already listed in your Quote, the line item will show up with the other ones in that section. If you select “None” this line item will be listed separately with its own heading Other Items. Let’s talk about these checkboxes. Check the first one if you want to include the line item in the price, but hide it on the Quote when it’s printed or emailed to the customer. The second option will allow for this item to be discounted if one is applied. And the third is where you designate if the item is taxable. This Quote is looking good. Let's add a Tax Rate. At the top of the Quote is the Price Settings area. To the right is one of those handy Edit icons. Click on it to Edit Price Settings. From the drop-down menu for Tax Rate, enter a Name, and a percent. The Discount field is where you can apply a Discount to this Quote when using your Price Lists. Anytime you manually enter or edit prices in Step 6, Discounts are not applied. Enter 10 to apply a ten percent discount to any items eligible for a Discount. To the right of each line item that is taxable, there's a letter “T” indicating tax was applied. Click on the “T” to see the details. When Discounts are applied, the letter \"D\" will appear by the line item indicating a Discount has been applied. Click on it to view the details.

Welcome to Quote & Order Forms. Log in to your CounterGo database. From the left-side navigation, click on Settings, Quote & Order, then Forms. You’ll see there are already some default Forms in your database. Let’s update the first one. You’ll need to change each Form individually. To make changes to the existing fields, all you need to do is click in the field to open the Edit Field box. Start with the header field to add your logo and contact information. From the Logo drop-down menu, select New Logo File, then Choose File To Upload. This will let you browse your computer and cloud storage to grab your logo. Under your logo, you can set the height and width. We recommend only setting one to avoid distorting the image. Take a look at the Subheader field, let's add your contact information here. Delete the fake information and enter anything you want to appear at the top of your Form when you print or email it to a customer. Just below the subheader, you can change the font, text color, and background color of the entire header field. It’s easy to reposition your fields. Click and hold on any field to drag it to a new spot. Watch for the two blue arrows with the orange line to show you where the field will be when you release the mouse. The location is based on where your cursor is, not necessarily the edges of the field you’re moving. You can also add additional fields to your Quote Form. The circle with a plus sign is the Add Icon. Whenever you see it in CounterGo you can click to add information. In the Data Type drop-down menu, there are two types of fields you can add, Related info, which will pull information that exists in your Quote or Order, and Formatting which will add fields that can help you customize how your form looks. I want to add the Salesperson field to this form, which is found in Quote/Order Info. From the Name drop-down menu, I see every possible field in this category I can add. When adding fields, they'll appear at the top of the Form, just under the header. I’ll click, hold, and drag the field where I want it to be. Adding in some empty space can make your Form more appealing. Let’s add a static Text Field and leave the text area blank to create some space. I want to remove the border around the field, so I’ll click on it again to edit. Towards the bottom, be sure you’ve selected the Cell tab to set the Border to 0px. Take some time to click around in each field to see what you can change. In the Quote Lines field, you can show or hide the total square footage and slab count, and set how you want your prices to display for the customer in the Show Prices For area. Take a look at the bottom of the Form and make sure the default text reflects how you do business. Need to make a change? Just click in the field and edit the text. We’ve looked at how to add fields, but what about how to remove them? I’m going to take this white space out, so I’ll click on it and then click the Delete icon. You can create new Forms from scratch, but sometimes it’s quicker to copy an existing form. See the small edit icon, by Form Template Info? Click on it to edit this area. Before we copy this Form, this is where we can designate if this Form is to be used for Quotes, Orders or both by making a selection from the Usage drop-down menu. Click the Duplicate icon I’ll name the copy then click Save. Once I make a new copy, CounterGo immediately opens it. I can see all my forms by clicking on Forms in the left-side navigation. There’s my copy at the bottom. If you want to change the order that the Forms appear in drop-down menus when you go to use them, click on any of the underlined numbers in the Sequence column. Click and hold on the double-sided arrow to move a Form up or down in the list. If there are Forms you’re not using, you can inactivate them so they’re no longer an option when printing and emailing. Open the form you want to inactivate and click the Edit icon across from Form Template Info. Underneath Usage, check the box to Inactivate this form. Don’t forget there are lots of places to find Help as you’re working. From the left side navigation, click on Help, then Search Help, to open our OnlineHelpCenter in a new window.

Welcome to Email Templates. Log in to your CounterGo database. From the left-side navigation, click on Settings, Quote &Order, Email Templates. CounterGo has two kinds of email Templates. My Email Templates are unique to the user login name. For example, I have two CounterGo users in my database myself, and Desmond. If I make a MyEmailTemplate, it will not be available for Desmond to use when he logs in with his unique username and password. Shared Email Templates are visible to any user logged into your database. If I make a Shared Email Template, it will be available for me, and for Desmond to use. Let’s make a Shared Email Template. Click on the Add icon. Your Email Templates will appear as a drop-down menu, when you go to use them. It’s a good idea to name the Template something that gives you an idea of which template it is, or who needs to use it. This name does not show in the email — or on the Quote or Order. I want to make a Template for my Sales team to use, so I’ll name it “Sales Team”. The email entered in the ‘From:” box, shows as the sender when the recipient gets your email. This is also where a reply from them will go. CounterGo can send and track outgoing Quotes and Orders only. Incoming email will go to the email inbox you specify in this area. By default, you’ll see your user name in the “From Name” field. Let’s change that to a person or company name — to look more professional. For the Subject Line and the Body, put in any standard text you don’t want to have to retype. When you go to use the email template, you can still modify the Subject Line and the Body. Make sure you don’t delete this “PDFLink” in brackets. That’s the link for your customers to click on to view their Quotes or Orders. You can add any text above or below it. This looks good, so I’ll save it — and now I have my first Email Template made. If you need to make changes to a Template, click on its name to modify. This is also where you can delete a Template — if you no longer need it. Time to take a look at where these templates are — and how to use them. Open an existing Quote, and from the top menu bar — click on the Email button. The very first menu will list all the Email Templates you’ve made. Right below that — you can select which Quote & Order Form Template to use. If you want a quick preview of how the Quote or Order will look for the customer, click on the Print icon at the top. Enter the email you want to send this Quote or Order to — and any additional text you want to add to the Subject Line or Body. Scroll down below your drawing. CounterGo tracks information like the date and time you sent the email, who you sent it to, how many times the customer has opened it and the most recent date and time they did, along with who sent the email. There may be times when you need to inactivate the link you emailed to a customer. Click on the date and time it was sent, then click the Inactivate button. The Quote link in the email you sent will no longer be active. To reactivate, click on the date and time again then click Activate Link.If you want to send the email again, click on Resend Message. You can also display when Email links to Quotes and Orders are viewed in your QuoteViews. There are lots of places to find Help as you are working.

      "content": "Get Started Video 7: Non-standard Waterfall & Multiple Edges OBJECTIVES Draw Waterfall Edges Select Multiple Edges Assign Multiple Edge Finishes TRANSCRIPT: Hi, this is Amelia from Moraware! Welcome to Waterfall & Multiple Edges. Log in to your CounterGo database. Make a new Quote so you’ll have a copy of what we do in your database. Creating waterfall edges has four parts, draw the pieces, indicate which edges will be mitered, add a second Edge Finish, then apply the Finish to the countertop pieces. In Step 1 draw the countertop, and also the apron pieces that will form the waterfall to the floor. Use this same process even if your pieces won’t go all the way to the floor. I’m going to add text to indicate what these pieces are. With all the counter pieces drawn, it’s time to indicate which of these edges will have a different Edge Finish. Go to Step 3. In this step, we are not indicating which Finish is going to be applied, only that it is not the same on all sides. This edge will touch the floor, so it can be unfinished. This edge will meet up with the top counter, so I’ll choose Additional Finished Edge. I’ll do the same on the main counter. Finished Edge Two is an option since I already applied it on one side of the piece. I’ll indicate what will be the mitered edge on this last piece. You may be wondering why “Finished Edge 2” does not appear in this pop-up. An Additional Finished Edge has not been applied to this piece, so it doesn’t show yet. I’m ready to assign the edge types. Step 5 is where you tell CounterGo exactly which edge finishes will be on each counter. We are going to add the additional Finish type and assign the finishes to the edges of our countertop pieces here. I’ll select a Product, Color, and one of my Edges. Next I’ll click on the Add icon next to Edge to add an additional Finish type. Notice that Edge 1 says it’s being used on 3 counters, but Edge 2, even though we selected “Miter” says “unused”. It’s time to tell CounterGo which finishes belong on which edges. You can work with the thumbnail image as is, or click on the four-sided arrows to make it larger. Starting with this piece on the left, I’ll click on the edge that will be mitered, it shows as “F2” in the drawing, and assign “Miter” to be used on this piece anywhere there is an F2. Even though we assigned “F2” on the previous piece, every counter can have a different finish, so we need to repeat the steps on every piece. Here on the center piece, two edges are marked as “F2”. Once we assign the first “F2” we don’t need to assign the other since they are on the same countertop piece. We’ll assign the miter on this last edge then we are all done. Now CounterGo knows the finished edge “Miter” is used on 3 counters. In Step 6, there are now line items with measurements for both Edge Finishes. Use the same basic steps if you have a countertop that needs different finished edges that are not a waterfall. The main difference is that you do not need to draw the apron pieces.

Welcome to Segmented Edges & Splashes. Log in to your CounterGo database. Make a new Quote so you’ll have a copy of what we do in your database. Draw a countertop in Step 1. Move to Step 2. This is where we’ll add a Bump-in, then segment the Edge. When you add a Bump-In or Bump-Out to an edge, you can segment that edge to apply different Splashes. So you can apply different splash heights to the same edge. Use this same process if you need to apply different Edge Fnishes to the same edge. Add a Bump-In that has a depth of zero point one. I’m going to enter the dimensions behind a cooktop so it’s Splash can be different than the rest of the countertop. CounterGo always rounds up, so the total square footage will be the same as without the Bump-in. Leave the position set to Center to automatically place it in the center of the countertop. Or offset the Bump-in by selecting Left or Right as the position, then enter the distance from the left or right where the Bump-in should begin. Move to Step 3 and select “Segment This Edge” from the pop-up menu. Now the edge is divided into 3 segments instead of one long one. Let’s give this edge Splashes of different heights. Starting on the left, click on the segment and select a 5-inch Splash. Do the same for the segment on the right. Click on the middle segment and select “Other Splash”. Enter the height for the full height Splash. Go to Step 5 and select your Material, Color and Edge. Under Area Slab & Layout arrange your counter and splash pieces on your slabs. In Step 6 you will see totals for the different Splashes. Don’t forget there are lots of places to find Help as you are working, including when you are in the Drawing steps.

You’re probably familiar with how to zoom in and out. CounterGo also has a Pan feature, because the drawing space available is much larger than it appears in the view window. Using a combination of these two features can help you navigate drawings that have a lot of pieces. I’ve opened a quote for a big job. With this many countertops, the measurements can get quite small. Using the Zoom In button from the right-side navigation, I can zoom to make changes. And of course, the Zoom Out button will do the opposite. Reset Zoom will switch it back to the original view, fitting all the pieces on the screen. I’ll Zoom back in and change some dimensions on this countertop. When I want to quickly move around to other pieces that are off-screen, I’ll use the Pan button. The larger, light green area is the total drawing area you have available. The smaller dark green rectangle represents the view you can see on the screen at any given time. You can see that the pieces not shown in my zoomed-in view are all in the Pan View. I can click and hold on the small rectangle and move it around to work on different pieces while zoomed in. Click anywhere in the drawing space to close the Pan window and edit a countertop. When you’re done, or if you get too zoomed in, click on Reset Zoom to snap back to showing all the pieces in your drawing.

Welcome to CounterGo’s Orders. Log in to your CounterGo database. You might want to pause the video and make a new test Quote to try making an Order. When a Quote sale turns into a real piece of business, you can change that Quote into an Order to track payments received. If you also use Systemize you’ll be able to convert the Order to a Job. Once you convert a Quote to an Order, you can cancel the Order, but it can’t be deleted. I’ll open a Quote that’s ready to go forward. I can convert the Quote to an Order by clicking the Order icon. Orders and Quotes look similar, but Orders have a Payment section. If you didn’t already set Payment Terms, you can enter terms manually now. See our help section for more on creating Default Payment Terms. Click on the Edit icon in the Order Info area. Next, click on the Edit Payment Terms icon. You can set Payment Terms to be either a percent of the total or a fixed amount. I’m going to set this to 50% expected for a deposit and the remaining 50% will be the balance due. When the Order Summary is expanded, the calculated Payment Terms are listed at the bottom. Once I receive a payment I can track that here in the Order. I’ll click on Add Payment across from Payments and enter the amount the customer pays, how they paid, and reference number and notes if needed. Those details show here once the Payment is recorded. Looking at the Order Summary again, the payment is reflected in the total. Payments can’t be deleted, but if you’ve made a mistake entering the payment, open the Payment and you can Void it. Or if you need to refund the payment to the customer, use the Refund icon. If an Order is no longer going forward, you can cancel it by clicking the Edit icon across from Order Info. An Order can be un-canceled by going to the same area of a canceled Order and clicking the Un-Cancel icon. Clicking on Orders from the left side lists all your current Orders, and you can customize these Views to display other information not already shown.

Let’s take a minute to talk about Pricing. A Price List is exactly what it sounds like, a place to store everything that goes into a Quote, and how much you charge. Look at the Retail Price List provided and you’ll see CounterGo has most of the common items already built-in; materials, edges, fab & install, sinks, cutouts, and more. Don’t see items that you charge for? There is a way to add those too. We recommend you start with one Price List, to track all your prices in one place. You’ll need to update each list when you have changes, so using the minimum number will save you time. It’s easy to apply discounts automatically or manually in any Quote or Order if you need to. You can quickly set what items should show on a Quote or Order, which ones can be manually changed, which are allowed to be discounted, and which items are taxable. Check out our other videos for detailed steps to get your Price List set up. And you can always call or email one of our friendly CounterGo experts if you have questions. Thanks for stopping by!",

Ready to add Materials and Colors to a Price List? Adding Materials and Colors for the first time or editing an existing Price List involves the same steps. From the left side, click on Price List, then the name of the Price List to modify. If you're just getting started, use the \"Retail\" Price List, built into your database. We encourage users to start with only one Price List since each one needs to be manually updated. Enter your highest prices and use Discounts when appropriate. Discounts can be applied to individual Accounts to be automatically applied, or they can be added manually when Quoting. Click on the Edit Price List button on the right in order to make changes. You'll see the navigation moves over to the left. And an indicator and the upper corner lets you know, you're making changes to the Price [00:01:00] List. Select Materials, then Add Material. There are two options for adding Material, Built-in, which has some of the most common Materials and Colors preloaded, and Custom. Adding a Custom Material allows you to enter Materials that might not be in that preloaded list. I'll select a Built-in Material. Then counter go we'll fill in the Material Type and a default Slab Size. Type directly into either field to change. Let's take a look at some options you can set. Allow Other Colors lets you add Colors to a specific Quote or Order without adding them to the Price List. Allow Discount will let you apply discounts to this Material when using it in a Quote. Edit Price On Quote means you can manually override the price and an individual Quote. Next is the list of preloaded Colors. Add or delete Colors from this list, and CounterGo will alphabetize the colors as long as they're added one per line. Color's can also be added to the Price List after adding a Material. If the Material is taxable, select the Tax Code \"Tax\". This indicates that the item is taxable. Tax Rates are set for an entire Price List under Settings, in Accounts, or a while Quoting. Click on a Material from the left sub menu, then click Add Colors to add a new Color to an existing Material. Type in names, or copy and paste from a file or spreadsheet, one name per line. To remove a Color click on the delete icon, it looks like a little trashcan, across from a specific Color. Check out the CounterGo Knowledge Base for more [00:03:00] articles and videos.

CounterGo Price Lists allow you to add items that are not already built into the Price List. From the left side navigation, click on Price Lists, then on the name of the Price List to modify. Click the edit Price List button to make changes. Click on Other Items then Add Other Item. There are two types of Other items you can choose from. An Item of list of items with single fixed prices, like faucets. The second type is a Unit Priced item, something that has a range of fees, like tear-outs. Let’s add one of each type, starting with a Single Price item. Name the Other Item then look at the available options to add. Hide On Quote will include a grey line item for you to see in Step 6, but will not show when printing or emailing your Quote or Order. Always Include this item on Quote will automatically add this line item to every Quote so you don’t forget to add it later Allow Discount Will allow this item to be discounted if a Discount is applied to the Quote Editable Price On Quote means that the price can be manually changed in Step 6. After the item is created, add nested items using the Add Option, then enter prices. Apply a Tax Code applied if necessary. Time to add a unit priced other item. Enter a name, then enter what unit of measure the total price is to be calculated with. I’m adding a tearout fee based on the square footage that must be removed. Unit priced other items have similar additional options, except for including the item on every Quote. Once the item is added, click Add Size to add ranges and prices. I have three rates for tear outs, so I’ll add those. The forst price box “each” refers to a base fee that applies to any number of units. I have a 150 dollar minimum for tearouts, so I’ll enter that for all three. If you don’t need a base fee, enter zero. The second box is the price per unit, in this case, square feet. I charge 40 dollars per square foot for small areas, 30 for tearouts up to 40 square feet, and 15 for anything over 40 square feet. Time to save the Price List and add these new charges to a Quote. Go to Step 6 of a Quote or Order. Click the Add icon next to any area and select from the drop-down list. I’ll add the faucet, choose a model, and leave it in the area I named “kitchen”. Click the Add icon again to add the tear out charge. Enter the total square footage of the tearout and select the area to be “none”. By selecting “none” the item is placed in a separate area.

Waterfalls & Mitered Edges, and their associated Mitered Cuts, can quickly be created in Step 3 when drawing a Quote. This feature creates the associated countertop pieces, no need to draw pieces manually. The price for mitered cuts and waterfall installation can be entered manually, or added to the Price List, for automatic calculation in Step 6. First, let’s create a countertop, then we’ll move over to the Price List. Draw the countertop in Step 1. Move to Step 3 and click on the edge that will have the waterfall or Mitered Edge. Select Mitered Edge or Waterfall, then enter the height. In Step 5 select a Material, Color, and Finished Edge. Click on Area Slab & Layout to arrange pieces on estimated slabs. The material pieces for the Waterfall or Mitered Edge were created automatically and can be positioned in the layout. Move to Step 6. Waterfall & Mitered Edge Material pricing is calculated based on the price of the Material selected in Step 5. The total Linear Feet of the Mitered Cuts in Step 6 includes cuts on both sides of the counter pieces as well as any adjacent edges. The price can be entered manually, or added to the Price List for automatic calculation. Let’s edit the Price List to add the price for mitered cuts, and enable a Waterfall Installation charge. Go to Price List > click on the name of the price list to update > then Edit Price List. Click on Mitered Edges & Waterfalls. The first option is the ability to hide the Mitered Edge or Waterfall Material line item in the Quote. In the next section, enter the price to charge for mitered cuts, then select or deselect available options. Hide on Quote will show the line item in gray while you’re working, but will not print on a quote or order. Allow Discount allows for cuts to be discounted if a discount is applied to the Quote. If Editable Price On Quote is checked, in Step 6 the price can be manually changed. A tax code can be chosen from the list of tax codes. Tax codes are created under Quote & Order Settings. Different prices and options can be set for different materials. Click Add Specific Material Price and select either a material type or a specific material, then select options and enter a price. If you have an additional flat fee charge for Waterfall Installation, enable the option from the drop down menu, then enter a price. If Waterfall Installation Charge is not enabled, it will not appear in Step 6. Waterfall Installation Charge has the same options as Mitered Cuts, and can also have different prices for different materials. When a CounterGo Order is converted to a Systemize Job, the imported Order Information includes the total Material needed for the countertop, and the Mitered Cuts total. If you have questions, the CounterGo Knowledge Base has more articles and videos.Or email one of our friendly CounterGo experts at support@moraware.com Thanks for stopping by.",

      "content": "Video: Quote Countertops Without Drawings TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to Quote Countertops Without Drawings. CounterGo has a feature to create Quotes based on measurements or total square footage instead of using a drawing. Quotes can have no drawing at all, or a mix of counters with, and without drawings. Details for counters without drawings can be added at any time during Steps One through Four. Let's start in Step One. From the right side navigation, click the Add Other Counter button. It's optional to name the counter, but when working without drawings, this can be very useful. Select to enter either the total countertop square footage or the measurements. Click Add Size to add more than one piece if needed. Enter the height and length of the Splash by inches or linear feet and the length of the finished Edge. If neither of these measurements are needed, click on the Delete icon to remove. If you need to add more than one Splash or Edge, click the Splash & Edge button and select from the menu. For Edges, you'll select which finished Edge to apply later in Step Five. Curves, Bump-Outs and Bump-ins can be quickly added to the Quote by clicking the Curves & Bump-outs button, and then selecting from the menu. Depending on what selected additional details for radius or dimensions can then be added. Use the Sink & Cutouts button to select Sink models or Cutouts, either those already entered in the Price List, or enter dimensions by selecting the Custom option. When all the information for this counter is entered, click Done. The counter will appear in the right navigation under Add Other Counter. Click on the underlined name to make edits. Click the Add Other Counter button to add additional countertops to this Quote, if needed. Move on to Step Five, to select a Product, Color, and Edge. New countertops without drawings cannot be added in Step Five, but edits can be made by clicking on the underlined counter name. In Step Six, check the pricing. If the Price List has not been filled in yet, click on any red, \"no price available\" to enter manually. Save the Quote, and now it's ready to be emailed or printed.

      "content": "What’s New: Moraware Recap Fall 2024 TRANSCRIPT: Hi, I'm Chelsea. Wondering what we've been doing behind the screen? Our development team is consistently working to update Moraware Systemize, Inventory, and CounterGo to provide you with the best experience for managing your business. From keeping your system secure, managing larger jobs, and making it easier to use Moraware products, here's a quick recap of just a few of the most recent feature updates. Let's start with an important topic, no matter what Moraware product you use. We've enhanced the security of your database and information with Two Factor Authentication at login. Enabling the feature is not required, but highly recommended since it's the best way to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Systemize Phases are a helpful way to break up larger Jobs and schedule smaller blocks of work separately. When viewing Job Details, the new Phase Filter option allows for selecting and viewing all Activities, Forms, Orders, and uploaded Files related to the Phase or Phases selected. This means less scrolling and easier visibility of only the information you need. For Systemize users who also use Moraware Inventory, recent enhancements allow for Serial Numbers to be searched to find specific slabs easier. Three new features in CounterGo make it easier to quote larger Jobs. Line item only Quotes Without Drawings can now be created. Quotes Without Drawings are helpful to quickly total square footage, especially when a drawing and measurements have already been provided. Square feet, or measurements, along with Curves, Bump outs, Splash, Edge, Sinks, and Cutouts can all quickly be added without creating a Drawing. CounterGo now has the option to create one drawing and then multiply the Quantities of the area in Step 6, making it faster to create multi-unit Quotes that use the same countertop layouts. Page Breaks can now be added to the Drawing Area when printing Quotes, making it easier to read larger or more complex layouts. This feature works best when printed or emailed with a Quote & Order form that has the Drawing Area set to the full width, like the built-in Quote With Large Drawing Form. Additional Countergo improvements were released to make Quoting and Drawing easier and more intuitive. Starting with Pan and Zoom when drawing, keyboard arrow shortcuts have been added when using the Pan feature. Use the Shift key and the mouse to Pan without selecting it from the side menu. Zoom now anchors to the center of the drawing space and works using a magic mouse, mouse with a scroll wheel, two finger touch on a trackpad, or keyboard plus and minus shortcuts. Waterfall and Miters can now be applied to non standard edges.Those that are segmented have bump outs or bump ins, notched or clipped corners. As with standard waterfalls and miters, the amount of Material required, as well as a charge for the two cuts between the pieces, is automatically calculated. The last CounterGo feature to highlight is the ability to add the Total Price as a Display Column in Quote Views. We're pleased to have added these new product features and updates to provide you with an improved Moraware experience. If you have any questions, reach out to our friendly Moraware Support Team at support@moraware.com.Thanks for stopping by!",

Begin in Step 1 by drawing a rectangle, but don't let go of your mouse. If you're working on a tablet or touchscreen device, don't lift your finger/stylus off the screen. As you pause, you'll see a 3-sided arrow appear. Once the 3-sided arrow appears, move your mouse (or finger/stylus) in the direction needed for your countertop. Pause again - without letting go of the mouse or lifting your finger/stylus - and draw the third side of your U-shape.",

There may be shapes that you can't recreate exactly. Sometimes it's best to only draw bounding rectangles to approximate square footage. Other shapes can be broken into smaller shapes instead of being drawn as one continuous piece. This will allow you to arrive at a useful price for your Quote. In some cases, it's preferable to print the Quote without the Drawing. In general, non-standard shapes are approximated and their areas are totaled. CounterGo will always round up, so your Quote should not be short when it comes to estimated material, it should calculate slightly larger. Our friendly CounterGo experts are also happy to help think through the best approach for non-standard shapes. For help, send an email with a picture of what you are trying to recreate to support@moraware.com. Not every shape can be translated to CounterGo, but our team has seen many unique counters over the years and can offer suggestions when applicable.",

In Step 3 you are telling the system if an edge has a finish style or does not, regardless of which edge style you will later choose. A finished edge is designated by the letter \"F\" and/or a number after it. An edge without a finished edge style is either Appliance or Unfinished. In Step 5 you tell the system which edge style to apply to each edge, regardless of the abbreviation in Step 3. Each time you click on an edge in Step 3, if that edge finish will be different from the other edges on that countertop, select Additional Finished Edge from the pop-up menu. In the example below, there are edges with and without a finish style on the L-shaped counter and each edge of the island has a different edge style. That totals of 6 possible edges for the entire Quote. Move to Step 5 and select to use 6 different edge styles by clicking Add Edge. Next, the edge styles will need to be assigned to each countertop. What you assign as \"F1\" on one counter is not automatically assigned to the same \"F1\" on another piece. Think of each countertop as unique. Click on the counter in the thumbnail and decide which edge style to assign to each different edge. In this example, the L-shaped counter is assigned first two edge styles on the list. Because there are 4 different edges for the island selected in Step 3 (F1-F4), there are 4 edge styles to assign in Step 5. You can use any of the 6 edge styles you previously added, each one is listed. Note: Once you have assigned each edge style to a Finished Edge, the list in Step 5 will show that each edge style has a counter(s) where it is used. if you see an edge style with \"unused\" next to the name, it has not been assigned.

      "content": "How Square Footage Is Calculated Not sure if you should draw an L-shape or use a Bump-out? How a countertop is drawn can impact how square footage is calculated. There are several different ways the same shapes can be created. Most of the time, the simplest way to draw a counter is best. What goes on behind the scenes in CounterGo is fairly complex, so the most direct way to describe how square footage is calculated is to say that shapes are approximated and totaled. The gray arrows may seem to be indicating the area being calculated, but they represent the length of the edge of the original shape drawn, which is not always the same as the dimensions of the final shape after angles, curves, clips, bump-outs, or bump-ins are applied. Pricing by the Slab is a good way to make sure you don't under bid. And using the Slab Layout feature in Step 5 allows you to visualize what will fit on each slab. The example below will show you an L-shaped counter drawn two ways, as a continuous shape or as a Bump-out. More complex shapes have their area calculated by approximating the shape with smaller shapes and overlaps. CounterGo will always default to rounding that total up, not down, so you will not underestimate when Quoting. The counter on the left was drawn as an L-shape in Step 1. The counter on the right was drawn as a rectangle in Step 1, then a Bump-out was added during Step 2. The grey arrows showing the edge measurements vary between the two. On the counter on the left, the square footage calculated by the rectangles inside the L-shape, shown in red. On the right side counter, the area is calculated by the larger blue box that surrounds the entire counter. The square feet calculated for the Material, Fabrication & Installation charges are different in Step 6. There is also a line item for the Bump-out for the counter on the right.",

If you send your CounterGo Orders to Systemize, or export your Orders to Quickbooks, we suggest scheduling a support call to talk over your process before following the directions below. Email us at support@moraware.com to set up a time to talk. When estimating commercial work, there are three steps to keep in mind: This method relies on pricing by the square foot, so calculate your square foot pricing. Draw and calculate the price for one counter or counter set. Adjust for tax. Pricing commercial jobs correctly is more complicated than pricing a residential job - so do your own due diligence before using this technique. Feel free to ask us for help if you have questions. CALCULATE PRICE AND ZERO WASTEWhen using this method to calculate commercial jobs, it is necessary to calculate pricing by the square foot, even if you normally price by the slab. Calculate the price you want to charge per square foot for your job. If you normally charge by the slab. The spreadsheet below can help you determine the square foot price for the commercial job. Calculate-zero-waste-sq-ft-price.xlsx Calculate-zero-waste-meter-price.xlsx CREATE THE QUOTEBasically, we will create and price a single room, then multiply by the number of rooms that will be in the job. Create a new Quote and draw the counter shapes in Step 1. For this example, let's make two counters with a simple splash and a sink. Proceed through the Steps 1-5 as you would for a regular quote. In Step 5, select Material, Color, and Edge.. Move to Step 6 and apply a tax rate as you normally would. In this example, only the physical items are taxed, your tax rules may be slightly different. Now you have the cost of one room including tax. Before adding an Other Item to multiply by the remaining rooms, tax needs to be added as a line item, then removed from the overall quote, otherwise, the tax would be applied incorrectly. Add an Other Item in the area for Single Apartment called \"Sales Tax on Goods\". Make sure the Other Item is NOT taxable. Edit your Price Settings to remove Tax Rate from the Quote. Now it's time to add an Other Item for the remaining rooms of the job called \"Additional Apartments 2-20\". Use the Subtotal price from Single Apartment and enter the remaining number of rooms. This practice quote is for an apartment complex with 80 rooms, so 79 additional rooms are needed. Make sure the Other Item is NOT taxable. MULTIPLE LAYOUTS WITH MULTIPLE ROOMSEven if you have more than one layout type, and multiple rooms per that layout, use the same approach. Create all layouts in Step 1. Assign each Layout its own Area in Step 5. Use the same approach as above to calculate the cost per area, adding a line item for tax for each area.",

We can show you where to enter the taxes you have to collect in our software, but we can't advise you on what gets taxed, how much, or even which tax to charge, consult your Accountant or other tax professional. When setting up CounterGo, you can think of taxes in two parts, naming the tax you collect and entering how much that tax is in the areas where you do business. Tax Codes are where you name the tax you have to collect. Tax Rates are where you enter a particular county, city, state, province, or region and a numeric value for how much that tax is. If you live in the US, you probably won't need to adjust your Tax Code, your database came with one called \"Tax\" built in. If you live outside the US and have to collect HST, GST, VAT, etc., you enter those in Tax Codes. Regardless of where you live and how many Tax Codes you have, you will need to create and enter the numerical values for each area you collect taxes in by going to Settings > Quote & Order > Tax Rates.

Edit the User Buddy and uncheck Login from anywhere. Considerations before setting up Login Locations: If your office does not have a static IP address, meaning it can change, it is very dangerous and unwise to use location-based security. If a location of 'Office Only' is defined and properly implemented, only users who log in from your office network will be allowed access. Mobile devices, home access, coffee shop access will all be denied, UNLESS a VPN (virtual private network) is set up so remote users can securely connect to the office network, then connect to Moraware. Identify which users should be restricted to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. Login Location is driven off of IP addresses ranges. Users must be selected for Login Location rules to apply - an empty list of Users means NO users fall under the location restrictions. Go to Settings > System > Login Locations and click + Create at the top of the page. Name the location and click the Multiple icon to select the Users restricted to this Login Location rule. Enter a single IP address or a range and Save. Go to Settings > Users & Roles > Users For each User on the list of restricted Login Locations, confirm restrictions are in effect by inspecting the Login From column in the User list.",

Or in other words, you are using QuickBooks Desktop but it is not installed on the same computer you use when you log into CounterGo. There are three general pieces needed for information to get from CounterGo to QuickBooks Desktop during the initial setup. A file with all the specifications, or what we call the CounterGo Export, is generated in CounterGo. This is what you download in Step 3 of the QuickBooks Export Setup. Next the QuickBooks Web Connector must be run, it's the bridge between CounterGo and QuickBooks. Last, the CounterGo specifications arrive in QuickBooks thanks to the Web Connector. The CounterGo Data File must be located on the same machine as QuickBooks for the setup to successfully complete. If you are using QuickBooks that is hosted on a server or on a remote desktop, the CounterGo Data File must be either downloaded on, or copied to, that server/remote desktop. SOLUTIONS Log into CounterGo in a browser on the remote desktop and complete the steps of the QuickBooks Export Setup. You can then log into CounterGo on the computer you normally use.OR Manually copy the CounterGo Export File from your computer to the remote desktop.

Include or exclude CounterGo Payments. Map CounterGo Price List items, Tax information to QuickBooks. One way communication from CounterGo to QuickBooks. Quick Books Online Simple Start, Freelancer/Self Employed and QuickBooks Desktop for Mac are not supported. If you are not a CounterGo user yet, visit moraware.com/pricing to schedule a demo. TRANSCRIPT: Hi, This is Evan from Moraware. Let’s talk about CounterGo’s QuickBooks Integration feature and if it is a good fit for your business. As you know, using CounterGo dramatically increases how quickly you can create and send professional looking Quotes. When a customer decides to go forward with your Quote, turn it into an Order, and track Payment terms and transactions, to keep well organized. If you keep your finances organized in Quickbooks, you have the option to export information from CounterGo via the QuickBooks Integration feature. CounterGo Orders can be exported to QuickBooks Online or Desktop, as Invoices or Estimates, with just a few clicks. You do need to be using Orders in CounterGo to take advantage of the QuickBooks Integration. Quotes can’t be exported to QuickBooks, only Orders. You have full control over which Orders get exported too. Setting up QuickBooks Integration does not automatically export all Orders. You decide which Orders get exported and when. If you are currently tracking financial transactions in CounterGo, you can select to export Payments along with the Order. If you track all financial transactions in QuickBooks, you can turn off the option to export CounterGo Payments. You can map customers to existing customers already in QuickBooks, or create new ones directly from the CounterGo Order at export. If you collect another Payment in CounterGo or change an Order after it’s been exported, CounterGo will remind you that it needs your attention, and exporting the updated Order to QuickBooks only takes a couple clicks. Updates from CounterGo to QuickBooks are “one way”. That means if changes are made to an Order in CounterGo, those can be updated in QuickBooks, but if changes are made in QuickBooks, that information is not sent back to CounterGo. The QuickBooks Export Status can be added to Order Views to see at a glance the status of any Order in the View. A full Export Status page lists each Order exported along with the time and date. CounterGo steps you through mapping taxes and items in your Price LIst into QuickBooks products and services. The mapping for products and services is not as detailed in QuickBooks as it is in CounterGo, most CounterGo Price List items are mapped into QuickBooks categories like material, labor and sales. If you use custom transaction numbers in QuickBooks, those need to be disabled in order to export from CounterGo. Not sure if using the QuickBooks Integration is right for how you do business? Send us an email or give us a call, we’re happy to talk details. Thanks for stopping by!",

      "content": "QuickBooks Integration Overview Curious about CounterGo's QuickBooks Integration? CounterGo Orders and Payment information can be exported into QuickBooks. This communication is one way, meaning information is sent from CounterGo to QuickBooks, nothing is sent from QuickBooks back to CounterGo. You have full control of which Orders get exported and when, Orders are not automatically exported. Once CounterGo Orders are exported to either QuickBooks Invoices or Estimates, or if Payments are tracked in CounterGo, they can be updated if the Order changes. You can customize your CounterGo Views to keep track of what has and has not been exported, or what may need updating. CounterGo will walk you through each step to integrate with QuickBooks. Some basics are outlined below, If you'd like to talk details, email support@moraware.com. If you are not a CounterGo user yet, visit moraware.com/pricing to schedule a demo. CounterGo Orders: Only Orders, not Quotes, can be exported to QuickBooks. If you have not already started using Orders, add it to your workflow before integrating with QuickBooks. QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Desktop: You can use either version of QuickBooks with CounterGo if you use a PC. Because CounterGo is web-based, if you use QuickBooks Desktop you'll need to also use the Web Connector that QuickBooks developed. The QuickBooks Web Connector does not support QuickBooks Desktop for Mac, so Mac users can use the Online version only for CounterGo integration. QuickBooks Online Simple Start and Freelancer/Self Employed are not compatible with the QuickBooks Integration. Custom Transaction Numbers: Custom Transaction Numbers in QuickBooks Online will need to be disabled to use CounterGo's QuickBooks Integration. QuickBooks Invoice or Estimate: CounterGo Orders can be exported to either QuickBooks Invoices or Estimates. Payments can not be attached to Estimates, CounterGo Payments can only be exported to Invoices. If you set up to export to Estimates and want to change and export Invoices, or vice versa, the settings can be edited. Payments: If you track Payments in CounterGo, those can be exported to QuickBooks Invoices, and updated if additional CounterGo Payments are recorded after the initial export. Exports are one way communication, if you record transactions in QuickBooks, they will not be reflected in CounterGo. It's best to track payments in CounterGo or QuickBooks, but not both. Tax: Before you begin, be sure you have set up your Tax Rates and Tax Codes in CounterGo the same as in QuickBooks. You will be prompted to map your CounterGo Tax to QuickBooks. We can show you where to enter the taxes you have to collect in our software, but we can't advise you on what gets taxed, how much, or even which tax to charge. Consult your Accountant or other tax professional. Item Mapping: Mapping items to QuickBooks will not have the same level of detail as your CounterGo Price List. Be sure you have your products and services defined in QuickBooks before you begin mapping in CounterGo. We recommend mapping your Price List items into general categories, like Material, Labor, Sales, etc. Views: After integrating QuickBooks, add the QuickBooks Export field to any View for a quick way to track if an Order has been exported to QuickBooks and the current status.",

For example, individual line items for Labor are rolled into one. Area names are shown if they were created in CounterGo, like \"Kitchen\" and \"Bath\".

      "content": "Video: Welcome To Systemize TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to Systemize. This video explains how Systemize works and the most important things to start doing right away. The other videos in this Get Started series go into the details of how to complete each of the tasks mentioned. And, there's a video dedicated to creating a Job step by step. We’ve helped thousands of Systemize users over the years. Although every shop is unique, there are some Systemize basics that successful users do right away, no matter what their shop set up or workflow. The most important thing you can do is start creating Jobs in your Systemize database. It doesn't matter if you enter real or practice info. If you create practice Jobs, you always have the option to delete them later. Creating Jobs will help you understand the fundamentals, then you can decide how to tailor Systemize to your specific needs. Let’s talk about how a Systemize Job is structured. In Systemize, all Jobs are organized by Accounts. No matter how you set up Accounts in your business, every Job in Systemize must be assigned to an Account. So to make a Job, we need to make an account first. When you create your first Job, you’ll be prompted to also create an Account. Don’t worry, you’ll be able to make more Accounts and organize them later. So what’s in a Job? Every Job contains a combination of Activities Forms, and Files. In addition to Job Activities, Forms and Files are ways to store information about a Job, and they are covered in detail in additional videos and articles. Let’s focus on Job Activities. Activities are tasks that get assigned to people. Activities like template, fabrication, install, invoice, and repair are the most basic. We’ll talk about how to color-code, rename and even change Activities in the Job Activities video. For now, practice with the built in default Activities. Job Activities are assigned to… Assignees. Assignees are not the same as Users, though a User can also be an Assignee. An Assignee has Job Activities assigned to them, a task that they complete outside of Systemize, like templating, fabricating, or installing. There is no limit on how many Assignees you have in Systemize, and unlike Users, there is no charge for Assignees. Assignees don’t get login information like a User does. Assignees can be people, teams, or even trucks. Many Systemize users display a daily calendar on a monitor in the shop, for all Assignees to see what they need to be working on. View who is assigned to the Activities in the Calendar or Job Views, and create views based on Assignees. In order for a Job to be considered Complete in Systemize, every Job Activity in the Job must be marked complete. Keeping Activity Statuses up to date will help you keep track of any Jobs that have outstanding or overdue activities. Great, so every Job must be in an Account. Jobs contain Activities that are assigned to Assignees. Those Activities get completed in order for the entire Job to be considered Complete. This page we’re looking at is called the Job Details page. It’s info about one specific Job. You might be wondering where you see information about more than one Job or Activity at a time. Two ways to display information about multiple Jobs are Calendar Views and Job Views. Let’s start with Calendar Views. Only Activities appear on the Calendar. Details from other parts of the Job that are related to an Activity can be displayed inside the Activity area on the Calendar. There are lots of ways to organize Calendar Views, Activities by Day and Time, by Assignee, or by activity schedules like Template, Fabrication, or Install, just to name a few. There are some default Views built in, and you can create and customize new Calendar Views, then save them for quick access later. Job Views are a powerful way to sort and display information about your Jobs. Job Views can show Account, Job, Activity, and Form information displayed as columns. Job Views can be sorted and resorted by any column at any time. Both Calendar Views and Job Views have some default Views built in to get you started. Remember how I mentioned marking Job Activities complete? There is already a built-in Job View to show any Jobs with past due activities. You can quickly see if there are any Jobs that have scheduled activities that did not happen, determine why, and reschedule if necessary. By creating practice Jobs right away, you can decide which Views are best for your shop, and other Views you may want to create. Create and save different Views to display different information based on who needs to see particular details that are important for the work they need to do. Time to recap. Every Systemize Job has to be in an Account. A Job holds information about the details and activities of the work that needs to happen to complete the Job. You can view the details of one Job, or see multiple Jobs, and their activities and information, using Calendar and Job Views. What’s next? Check out the remaining videos i",

When you're new to Systemize, the quickest way to learn is by making Jobs, even practice ones. If you create practice Jobs, you'll always have the option to delete them later.Creating Jobs will help you understand the fundamentals. Then you can decide how to tailor Systemize to your specific needs.In Systemize, every Job must be assigned to an Account. Each Job holds Activities, Forms, and Files, all the information about that Job in one place.Let's make a practice Job. Click on Jobs from the left menu, then the Create Job button from the top menu. Enter a name for this Job. When your database is new, you won't have any Accounts entered unless you already have CounterGo.Click on the More button next to the Account field. In the top bar, click the Add icon to enter a new Account. For now, leave the Template set to Standard Job. Templates are a way to select all the items you want to appear in a Job and apply them when you create the Job, instead of manually adding each component after.We have more resources in the Systemize knowledge base that detail Templates, how to create them and edit them.When a Job is created, the Job Address defaults to the Account address. Use the Edit icons across from Account address or Job address to enter an address for the entire Account, and a Job Address if it's different from the Account Address.Let's move to Activities. Click on the underlined name of the Template Activity. Change the status to confirmed. Select a start date, and a scheduled time. The duration can also be changed.If you don't have any Assignees entered yet, click the Multiple button, then the Create icon from the top. Enter Assignee names, one per line. Select the Assignee or Assignees for this Activity. Once added, they'll appear in the dropdown menu. Or you can always select more than one Assignee using the Multiple button.An Assignee is not the same as a User. Assignees are associated with an Activity and can be viewed in Job Details and Job and Calendar Views.Assignees can be people, teams, or even equipment like trucks. Unlike Users, Assignees are not given a username or login. There's no charge for Assignees, and no limit on how many you can have.After saving the edits to the Template Activity, I see my remaining Activities auto-scheduled from the Template date.The Auto-Schedule feature helps prevent Activities from being overlooked or going unscheduled. Auto-Schedule events can be edited by clicking on any underlined name and making changes if necessary. If you need help with the dependencies of the Auto-Schedule feature, check out the Systemize knowledge base, or get in touch with one of our friendly experts at support@moraware.com.Back to our Job. There are default Forms in the Job you created. Click the Edit icon across from any Form to enter information.The final item we'll look at in the Job Details page is where to attach Files. Scroll to the bottom, then click the Add icon to attach a File. There are some default File Types in your database, and these can be customized and new File Types added.Now that we have a Job entered, let's see how it looks on the Calendar. From the left side menu, click on Calendar. Click inside any Activity to edit details. Activities on the Calendar can also be moved by clicking, holding and dragging. If I move the Template Activity, the other Activities set to Auto-Schedule will automatically update.Let's look at a Job View. Click on Jobs on the left. If this is the first Job you've created, it will be the only Job that appears. Click on any underlined word to make quick edits. Click on the underlined Job name to return to the Job Details page for that specific Job.If you'd like to delete a test Job, click on the Edit icon next to Job Info, then the Delete icon in the top menu bar. This is a permanent action. Deleted Jobs cannot be recovered.We've covered the very basics of how to create your first Systemize Job. We encourage you to create more Jobs, get familiar with your database, and determine any changes you need to make.Check out the Systemize knowledge base for more articles and videos.If you'd like to talk with one of our friendly Systemize experts, email support@moraware.com.",

In Systemize, all Jobs are organized by Accounts. No matter how you set up accounts in your business, every Job in Systemize must be assigned to an Account.When you create a Job, you can create an Account at the same time. You can also enter and manage your Accounts all in one place without creating a Job. From the left side, navigation, click on Settings, Account, Accounts. This is where you'll see all your Accounts in one place. Let's add an Account then look at the details page of that account.Click the Create button at the top. Name the account. If you also use Moraware CounterGo, you'll see your Price List associated with the Account.This is the Account Details page, visible once you create an account. More information will automatically appear on this page once you start creating Jobs. There's also a space to add an Account Address and Contacts for the Account, with their information. From the left side navigation, click on Accounts to see a full list of all Accounts displayed.The display columns can be customized. In the top menu bar, click the Customize button. Add, remove, or reorder, which columns are displayed, and you can add or remove filters. These features will become more useful as you add more Accounts. If you customize an Accounts View and plan to use it again, click the Save button in the top menu bar to save the View for quick access later.When saving an Account, Job, or Calendar view, you have the option to save it as a Shared View or My View. A Shared View means it will be available for any of the Users who log into your database. When you save Views as My View, they're only available for your login credentials.Like the Account Details page, the Accounts View will automatically fill in more information as you create more Accounts and Jobs.We've covered how to create an Account, where to manage your Accounts and how to customize and save Accounts Views.Check out the Systemize Knowledge Base for more articles and videos.

Every Job contains Activities that need to be assigned and completed. There are no Assignees in your database when you start.Before adding your Assignees, let's quickly review the differences between Assignees and Users. Users are individuals who need to log into the database to do things like create Jobs, update Calendars, assign Activities, update Activity Statuses, and add information to Forms. They do work inside the Systemize database. Users have login credentials and there's an additional charge for extra users above the number included in your subscription. There may be some people who need to be both Users and Assignees.Let's talk about Assignees. Assignees are responsible for activities tracked in Systemize those activities are performed outside of Systemize, like templating, fabrication or installation. Assignees are associated with an Activity and can be viewed in Job Details and Job and Calendar Views. Assignees can be people, teams, or even equipment like trucks. Assignees are not given a username and login. There's no charge for Assignees and no limit on the number that you can have.Let's add a new Assignee. Click on Settings, Job, Assignees. In the top menu bar, click the Create button. Enter Assignee names, one per line. Assignees are added in alphabetical order the first time they're entered. Click on any Assignee Name to edit the color associated with that Assignee. Giving each Assignee a dedicated color is useful for Calendar views and when using the Map feature.Let's add two install trucks as Assignees. Click the Create button. Enter the names, one per line. Now there's the option to add these Assignees at the top of the list or the bottom.There may be a time when an Assignee is no longer needed. Although Assignees can be deleted, we recommend using the Inactivate feature. This will retain a log of everything the Assignee worked on.Click on the Assignee name, then check Inactive Inactivated Assignee can also be restored. Deleted Assignee cannot be recovered.Let's move the Inactive Assignee to the bottom of the list. Click on any Sequence number, then click hold and drag to reorder how the Assignees are displayed. This also determines how the Assignees will appear in dropdown lists. The most used Assignee names can be placed at the top for quick access.Now you're ready to assign Activities to these new Assignees. You can set certain Activities to automatically be assigned to a particular Assignee, and even set yourself as an Assignee. We'll dive into those topics in other articles and videos.For now, check out the remaining videos in this Get Started series.For more articles and videos, visit the Systemize knowledge base.If you'd like to talk with one of our friendly Systemize experts, email support@moraware.com.",

Every Job contains Job Activities to keep track of the work that needs to be done.Your database has some default Job Activities built in. To get you started, let's take a look at where to find Job Activities, how to edit their names, color coding, and order. We'll also confirm the basic default Activities, learn how to set a duration, and default Assignees.It's best to think of Job Activities as tasks that get assigned to a person on a particular day that have statuses associated with them.Remember, in order to complete Jobs, every Activity in the Job must be marked, complete or canceled. That's why we recommend starting as simple as possible. Begin with the default activities, then determine if more Activities are needed after you've made several Jobs.While you can add Activities with just a few clicks, new Activity Types will need to be added to Job Templates, Calendars, and Job Views.See the Systemize knowledge base for more resources on creating new Job Activities.From the left side navigation, click on Settings, Job, Activity Types. Displayed are the default Activity Types in your database.Starting at the top, there are three buttons. All, Job, and Lead. Lead is grayed out because that Process is inactive by default. We have another video, Systemize Leads, that will show you how to use this Process. There's a link to it in the transcript below. Click on the Job button at the top to see only the Activities associated with Jobs.Before we make any changes, look at what each Activity is named, the assigned Color, the Status, and the Dependency if there is one.Activities like Fabrication, Install, and Invoice are set to a status of Auto-Schedule, so they'll automatically generate a date based on a Dependency.Before we make any changes, notice several things are underlined on this page. When you see information underlined like this in Systemize, it means you can click on it to make edits.Let's edit the Template Activity. Click on the underlined name, Template.The edit screen allows you to change everything except the Sequence Number and Dependency. We'll cover those shortly. If you already have assigned colors for activities in your shop, and they're different from what these defaults are, click on the Color icon to select a new color.Leave the default Status of Template as Tentative. This will allow you to select the date in each Job when you're ready.If this Activity usually takes a certain amount of time, setting a default Duration will help scheduling your teams. If this Activity is usually assigned to a particular person, select them from the dropdown list.To select more than one Assignee, click on the Multiple button, then check all Assignees necessary. The default Assignee can be manually changed in the Job later if needed.Setting default Durations and Assignees will help streamline scheduling, and avoid Activities not being assigned to someone. When you create a Job, you have full control to edit any default Duration or Assignee in each individual Job. The Description field is for notes about this Activity for your internal use.If you've made any changes, click Save. If not, click the Exit icon in the upper right corner.Now let's talk about the Auto-Scheduled Activities and their Dependencies. Like Durations and Assignees, using Auto-Schedule will place Activities on the Calendar based on the Dependencies you set, and avoid the costly mistakes of forgetting to schedule a critical task in a Job.These can also be manually changed within individual Jobs. They're not fixed.Look at the default Dependencies. If they work for you to start making Jobs, great. No need to change anything. If you need to modify the number of days, click on an underline Dependency and make any edits. Leave Reverse Dependency and Ignore For Auto-Schedule unchecked.The article Reverse Dependencies, in the knowledge base, provides more details on what Reverse Dependencies are and how they might need to be used. To remove a Dependency, click the Delete icon, then change the default Status of the Activity to Tentative. Auto-Schedule Statuses must have a Dependency rule in order to work.Finally, let's take a look at how to reorder how Job Activities are displayed. You'll see each Job Activity has a Sequence Number.Click on any underlined Sequence Number, then click hold and drag to reorder the Activities.That wraps up this introduction to default Activities in Systemize. Start creating Jobs and assigning Activities, keeping Statuses up to date to determine if you need to adjust the defaults to better suit your setup.Check out the Systemize knowledge base for more articles and videos.If you'd like to talk with one of our friendly Systemize ex",

As you create more Jobs, use Calendar and Job Views to display and organize the related Job information and Activities.This video is going to cover the basics of Calendar and Job Views. There's lots of detailed information in the Systemize knowledge base for both Calendar and Job views. Let's begin with Calendar Views.In Systemize, information about a Job's Activities appear on the Calendar. There are many ways to customize Calendar Views to display information for different needs. Clicking Calendar from the left side navigation will take you to the default Calendar View that you've set.I've already created some Jobs in my database, so there are some Activities that will appear on a Calendar. Only Job Activities appear in Calendar Views, but Job info, Activity, info and Form info related to that Activity can appear within each Activity box that appears on the Calendar.We've included some default Views in your database. Click on Views from the top menu bar, then select a View. Every View can be customized and saved for quick access later.Click the customize button from the top. As you can see, there's a lot of information you can change. I am going to create a View that displays the day, lists my Assignees, and breaks out the work hours so I can see what each person has on their schedule, and make changes when I need to.I want to see a Calendar for seven days at a time. I'll change the Display Type to Day & Assignee by Time. In the next section, select the Activity Types to display. I'll leave Assigned To blank, which will display all my Assignees. Individuals or groups can be selected instead, if you want to display schedules for particular people and then save those views. Filters are another way to sort through what information you see, and can be added or removed. These defaults look good, so I'll leave them as they are for now.Display Fields allow you to change what appears inside each Calendar box. I want to remove the Account name, so I'll click on the Remove icon. Click hold and drag Fields up or down to change what order they will appear within the Activity box on the Calendar.Add Display Fields by clicking the Add icon. I don't need to add any new Fields, so I'll scroll to the bottom and be sure Wrap Text and Auto Refresh are both checked.This view will be listing Assignees along the side of the Calendar. And I want boxes color coded by the Activity Type.After applying these changes, I have a new Calendar View.For quick access later, be sure you save any customized Views.Keep in mind calendars only display activity information for the activity happening that day in the date range selected. If you're looking for additional information about Jobs you'll want to make a Job View.Activities can be moved around on the Calendar. Click hold and drag activities to new times or to different Assignees. They'll automatically update in the Job. Before leaving this page, I'll save the view so that I don't have to recreate it each time I want to see information displayed like this.To save the View, click on the Save View button in the top menu bar. I'm going to save this View as a New View. That will leave the settings untouched In the original View we started with. Give the new View a name and select for it to be either a Shared View or a My View.A Shared View will be available to anyone who logs into the database. My Views are only for your login and visible to you. You can also set this View to be your Default View, so that every time you click Calendar on the left, this is the View that will come up.Time to check out Job Views. Click on Jobs in the left side menu. In Job Views, information is displayed in columns and can be sorted by any column. And each column can be sorted in ascending or descending order.Click on the column header to change ascending or descending order.The column that is currently being used to sort will always appear dark blue with a small triangle to indicate ascending or descending sorting.Anything that's underlined in Job Views can be clicked on to open or edit.Clicking on the Job Name will take you to the Job Details page, where you can view all of the information for that one Job.Just like Calendar Views, there are some default Views built in. Click on the Views button to see a list of Views already in your database. Also like Calendar Views, any View can be customized by clicking the Customize button.Filters can be applied and removed to control what Jobs are displayed in any View.Display Fields in Job Views refer to the columns shown on the page. They can be added, removed, or reordered.At the bottom is the option to Auto Refresh. It's a good idea to have this checked so that any changes made by another user will be updated in the View.

Create Activity TypesActivities keep track of what needs to happen, when it will happen, and who is responsible. Create AssigneesAssignees are not the same as Users. There is no charge for Assignees, they can be individuals, teams, or even equipment. Activities get assigned to Assignees, so it's easy to see who is responsible to get Activities completed. Create An AccountEvery Job in Systemize must be in an Account. You can create Accounts for builders, designers, homeowners, or other groupings. Edit An Existing Job FormSystemize has default Job Forms built in, they hold details about the Job and Activities. Forms can be created, modified, or removed. They are customizable, you decide what information should go into each Form. There are a variety of Form Field types to choose from, like auto-number, date, currency, list of values, number, and text entry. Job TemplatesJob Templates allow you specify what Activities and Forms need to go into every Job. Create A JobEntering Jobs is the best way to get familiar with Systemize. Start entering real jobs or make up practice ones. Either way, adding the information that is important for how work moves through your shop will help establish your Systemize habits. Schedule ActivitiesEnter dates, times, and Assignees to keep track of when and how work is going to happen in Jobs. Enter Details In FormsForms hold information about the Job like countertop details, provide checklists, and can be part of printed packets. They are a place to gather information about Jobs that can also be analyzed later. Attach Related FilesCustomer drawings, CAD files, shop drawings, signed contracts, all those can be uploaded into a Job to keep information organized. Use Job IssuesThink of Job Issues like the sticky notes that went into, or on, paper file folders. Job Issues can flag items in a Job, and you never need to worry about them accidentally falling off. Intro To Calendar Views and Intro To Job ViewsCalendars and Job Views can be customized in countless ways to best display information for different people. You can select the format of the Calendar View, which Fields to show, and what columns to display in Job Views.

But every Job must be assigned to an Account. Each of those Jobs will contain some combination of Activities, Forms and attached Files. Larger Jobs can be divided into Phases when work is happening over several months. Only Activities appear on the Calendar.

This video is a quick overview of how Systemize works. Each Systemize database is unique. The information you enter into your database can only be accessed by users you assign, and they can only make the changes you give them permission to do. Every Job in Systemize has to have an Account. An Account can have one Job , like an individual homeowner, a couple Jobs, like a repeat customer, or many Jobs like a big box store. Jobs consists of Activities, Forms and Files. Larger Jobs, maybe broken into phases to manage work over longer periods of time. Activities appear in Jobs and on Calendars. They determine what needs to happen to take a Job from beginning to completion and show at a glance where a Job is in your process. The status of the Activities in a Job, determine if a Job is complete. Jobs with all Activities completed are considered to be done. Forms hold information you enter about the Job like material information, or other important details. Both Forms and Activities are customizable to fit your business process. Files can be any external items that you need to be attached to a Job, like a scan of a signed contract, other PDFs, or images. You'll tell systemize what Activities and Forms are needed in your Job via Job Templates. Additional Activities and Forms can be added just a few clicks. Global navigation is located along the left-hand side and can be pinned, open or closed for more screen space. Navigation relative to where you are in your database and what you can do will appear along the top. The Systemize Knowledge Base has lots of how to articles and videos is continuously updated. Our friendly Systemize experts are always happy to help you customize your database to ensure your success. The quickest way to get in touch with us or set up a call is to email support@moraware.com.

There are three options to use as a start location. An Assignee address, the Shop Default Start Location, or a one-time Custom Address are all available to use as the start of the Activity routes.Which one does Systemize use? Mapped routes will use an Assignee address first if one has been entered. If multiple Assignees are being mapped, each Assignee's route will begin from the saved Assignee address.If no Assignee addresses have been entered, routes will be mapped automatically from the Shop Default Start Location, if that location has been set.If no Shop Default Start Location has been set, Systemize will map without a start location unless a Custom Address is entered.Entering a one-time Custom Address will ignore both saved Asignee addresses and the Shop Default Start Location, and map all routes from the one-time address entered.Let's take a look at where to set each location.If some Assignees always begin their routes from their home, or locations other than your shop, an individual start address can be set for each Assignee.Go to Settings, Job, Assignees. Click in the Map Start Location column for any Assignee, to add their default start address. Click again on an entered address to edit or delete. If routes usually start from your shop, enter a Shop Default Start Location. Once saved, you won't have to enter it each time you map routes.Go to Settings, Calendar, Map. Click the Add icon and enter a new address.After you Save, you'll be prompted to confirm the address. If you need to make changes after a Shop Default Start Location has been saved, come back to this page. Click the Edit icon to make changes or to remove.There may be times when a route needs to be mapped from a location other than your shop or a usual Assignee start location. Use a one-time Custom Address. Custom Addresses will ignore saved Assignee and Shop Default Start Locations and are only used for the route you are mapping.Custom Addresses are not saved.From any Calendar View, click the Map button.Select Enter Custom Address, enter the address, then Confirm the location.If you have more questions, check out the help center in your database.

      "category": "How-To Videos",
      "product": "Systemize",
      "content": "Video: Systemize Leads TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to Systemize Leads. Systemize is built around something we call a Process, to group information at a high level, like Jobs. Processes are also customizable. By default every database has an inactive process called Leads that can help track potential customers and conversion rates, separate from Job information. Let’s make this Process active and set up Leads to capture potential customers and track conversions. We’ll start in Settings. Select Job, then Processes. Lead is grayed out because it is not active. Click on the underlined name, uncheck “Inactive”, then Save. Processes like Jobs and Leads hold Activities and Forms for collecting information. First we’ll look at what Activity Types are already in our Lead process, and we’ll add one for tracking conversions. Go to Settings, Job, Activity Types to add existing Activity Types to the Process. Next to Process, click on Lead, so we can see only Lead Activity types for now. By default, there are a few Activity Types built in, Phone, Email, and Quote. The Quote activity Type is only a reminder that the activity needs to happen, it’s not a way to create a quote. We’ll talk more about this in a moment when we visit Templates. For now, let’s add one new Activity Type. Click on the Create New Activity Type button, enter Lead Created, select Lead for the Process, and enter a description if needed. The new Activity Type will appear at the bottom of the list. Click on the underlined name, and set the status to Complete. This Activity Type is a way to track when the potential customer is entered in the system, so it does not need a status that requires further action. You can assign a color, a duration, and a person, if it needs to automatically be assigned to one. Most users leave both of these fields blank. If you need to add any other new Activities, repeat the steps. Activity Types can apply to multiple processes, like phone call or email. If there are Activity Types that already exist for Jobs, that you also need in Leads, click on Assign Activities, then check any that need to also apply to Leads. I mentioned tracking conversions of Leads to Jobs. To do that we need to add a Job Activity Type. At the top, next to Process, click on Job. Click Create New Activity Type, then name this Job Sold!, and also set the status to Complete. Using these two Activity Types, the Lead can be converted to a Job, retaining all previous notes and communications, and the Job Sold! Activity will indicate when the Job begins, in other words, when the Lead converts to a Job. Now, click on All next to Process. You will see the new Activity Types listed at the bottom. It’s optional to re-order them. To do so, click on any sequence number, then click, hold and reorder the Activity Types in a way that makes sense for your business. Time to take a look at Forms. Go to Settings, Job, Job Forms. Click on Leads at the top. To add existing Forms, click on the Leads tab at the top, then Assign at the top to add existing Forms to the Process. I want to create a new Form that captures some basic Lead Information. Click on the Create Lead Form, and give the Form a Name, Like Standard Lead. I want to keep this simple and just capture basic information. I”ll click anywhere inside the lower grey rectangle to add some fields. Select Lead Info as the Data Type then use the Multiple button to select several Fields to add at once. This Form can always be edited later. Visit the Systemize Knowledge Base for more on creating Forms, and for sample Forms of commonly used. The last step related to Leads is making sure the Lead Template includes all necessary Activities and Forms. Every time you create a Job, you use a Template that automatically pulls in Activities and Forms. The same is done with Leads. Go to Settings, Job, Templates, and click on the Lead tab at the top. Click on Standard Lead, then add in any additional Activities or Forms. When adding existing Activity Types to Leads, “Yes” must appear in the Leads column. If it says “No”, go back to the Activity Types and make sure it has been added to the Lead Process. Let’s talk about the Quote Activity Type. Though Quote is in your database by default, it is not in the Standard Lead Template by default, to avoid confusion for Users who have both Systemize and CounterGo. The Quote Activity Type is only a reminder that the Activity needs to happen, it is not a way to create a Quote. If you don’t use Moraware CounterGo, you may want to add Quote to the Lead Template. If you use CounterGo, you’ll be able to attach the Quote to either the Lead or the Job. One last step if you want to track conversions. We created the Job Activity called “Job Sold!”, and it is set to Complete by default. Now it needs to be added to the Job Template. At the top, click Job. Open each Job Template you use, click the multiple button, and add in Job Sold!. This will add the Job Sold! Activity to every Job created going forward, but it",

You can create new Templates or modify existing ones as Activities and Forms are added or inactivated. Click on any underlying Sequence number, and you can change the order Templates are displayed in drop down lists. Let's make a new Template. Go to Settings, Job, Templates, then click the Create button. Name the Template and select the Activities and Forms you want added to the Job each time this Template is used. When adding Activity Types and Forms to Templates, they need to be part of the Process that the Template is used in. How can you tell? When you add the Activity or Form to the Template check to make sure that there is a \"Yes\" in the Process column. If it says\"No\", the Activity or Form needs to be added to the Process. It's a quick fix. Go to Settings, Job Activity Types. Find the Activity, look all the way over to the right under the Process you are making the Template for, and click the word \"No\" to add the Activity. Repeat the same steps for Job Forms if needed. New Activities and Forms can be added to existing Job Templates with a few clicks. Back to Settings, Templates, click on the Template name, and add or remove Activities and Forms. This will change in every Job made from the modified Template. For existing Jobs, the new Activity must be manually added to each Job. I'm ready to create a Job using this Template. I'll go to Jobs, then Create. The Activities and Forms in the Template are automatically added to the Job. Check out the Systemize Knowledge Base for more articles and videos.

I'm going to show you how to go from Quote to a completed Job. Let's get started by making a Quote. I'll draw an L-shaped counter with an island. I'm going to keep this simple. So I'll only add a sink cutout in Step Four, then select my Material, Color and Edge in Step Five. I set up Payment Terms ahead of time, so a quick look at the Quote Summary shows the amounts due and when. Once my customer decides to go forward, I'll convert this Quote to an Order. Orders Views can be customized, just like Quote Views and show additional information like Payment Status, Total Due, Total Paid and Square Footage. Now I'll record the initial deposit my customer left to secure the job. Tracking my transactions in Orders will also allow me to export directly to QuickBooks. I'm ready to create a Job directly from this Order. You can start a Job from a Quote, but using Orders will pull information like Price, Total Square Feet, Material, Color, Splash, Edge, and Sinks directly into the Job. If you start all your Jobs in CounterGo, this Order info can now be used in Reports, and then the Calendar subtotals. Now that I have my Job created, I can schedule Activities and track Job progress. Remember to complete Activities as they happen so that the Job can be considered complete. We have lots of additional information in both the CounterGo and Systemize Knowledge Bases for more detailed steps.

This video highlights the difference between Assignees and Users, and how to create each. You may be wondering how Assignees and Users are different. Assignees have tasks assigned in Systemize, but complete those tasks outside of the database, like templating, fabrication, or installation. Users need to do work in Systemize to keep track of Job details, Job progress, and customer and Account information. Some individuals may need to be both an Assignee and a User. Others may only need to be one or the other. Let’s take a look at Assignees first. Assignees have Activities assigned to them, and may need to view things in Systemize, like the Calendar. Using Assignees helps you keep track of who is responsible for tasks to get Jobs completed. Assignees can be individual people, they can also be things like teams or even trucks. There is no charge for Assignees, and no limit on how many you have. Creating them only takes a few clicks. Under Settings, Job, Assignees, click the Create button. Enter one Assignee name, or several at a time, one name per line. The Sequence column shows what order the names will be displayed in drop-down lists. To change the order, click on any underlined number, then click, hold and drag to move the name up or down the list. Click on any Assignee name to enter a description, and add a color for color coding calendar displays. This is also where you can inactivate an Assignee, so they no longer show as an option, but a record of their work is retained. Calendar Views are a great way to display Activities by Assignee, providing information at a glance about who needs to be doing what. Many customers keep Views like this on an easily accessible monitor in the shop for everyone to see. Now, let's talk about Systemize Users. Users are individuals who need to log into the database to do things like create Jobs, update Calendars, assign Activities, or add information to Forms. Systemize Users can also be created in a few quick steps. Go to the Settings, Users & Roles, Users, then click the create button. If you also use CounterGo, you can select any existing CounterGo user and add them to Systemize. They will only need one log in, if users have both CounterGo and Systemize access, they can toggle between the two. To create a new user, enter a username, without any spaces. A little further down you’ll be able to enter their full name. Give the user a password, and confirm it by reentering. If you want the user to change this initial password when they log in, check the box “Must Change Password”. It’s very important to enter an email address for the User. This email address is where a recovery link will be sent if they forget their password. Selecting an Assignee or Salesperson, will automatically attach those individuals to Jobs and Activities when they are created by this User. Selecting Login from Anywhere will allow the User to log in from any computer or device with internet access. User access can be limited to certain computers or locations, if you know the IP addresses of those specific computers. Every Systemize User must have a Role. Roles specify permissions in the database. Not every User has to have the same set of permissions. Roles are assigned to Users and allow or limit User functionality. There are Roles built in to Systemize, and they can be customized, or more can be created to suit your needs. Unlike Assignees, there's a charge for additional Users over the number included in your subscription. Check out the Systemize Knowledge Base for more articles and videos like this one.

Gather the information for a Job you're ready to schedule. Before you begin, decide on how you're going to name Jobs and Accounts to keep them consistent. This will help with searching and sorting Jobs later on. Every Job must be assigned to an Account. Accounts can be builders, dealers, or individual homeowners whatever's best for the way you do business. If you work with builders or dealers, it makes sense to create Accounts for those builders and dealers and assign individual Jobs to them. For homeowners or other standalone Jobs, we recommend creating an individual Account. It requires one more step while creating the Job, but it will make reporting managing contacts and creating mailing lists easier. Let's make a Job. Click on Jobs, then the Create button from the top of the page. Enter the Job Name. If you already have Accounts in your database, start typing the name in the Account Field to bring it up. If you need to create an Account, click on the More button. Then click the Add icon to enter and save a new Account. Once you save the Job Name and Account, Systemize opens the Job Details page. This is where you can access all the information about an individual Job in one place. Job and Account information, Activities, Forms, CounterGo Quotes and Orders, if you also have Countergo, attached Files, Phases, and Job Issues are all found here. Click on any Edit icon to enter information. In this example this is an individual homeowner, so I created an Account for them. In this case, the Account address is the same as the Job address. Entering Jobs is the best way to get familiar with Systemize. Start entering real Jobs or makeup practice ones. Either way, adding information that's important for how work moves through your shop will help establish your Systemize habits. There are more videos and articles in the Systemize Knowledge Base.

This video is designed for customers who may have used Moraware JobTracker, those who have used Systemize, but have taken a break. Or new employees at companies that currently use Systemize. Let's walk through using Systemize for a day at my countertop company. In the morning, my shop manager logs into a workstation for the entire shop crew to view. Each person can see what's assigned to them, what's on the schedule, and update their tasks as work happens. Completing Activities is essential for closing out Jobs in Systemize. Up in the front office, my scheduler's adding new jobs that have come in. In Systemize, it's easy to create a Job in the appropriate Account, and add customer contact info. I'm one of the admin Users and set up Job Templates ahead of time. So when a job's created, all the necessary Activities and Forms are automatically pulled in. My team can quickly schedule Job Activities and assign them to the appropriate person or group. We customized the Auto-Schedule feature with our Job Activities. When the first Activity in the Job is scheduled, the other Activities automatically fill in based on how we go from template to install. This prevents us from dropping the ball by having Activities go unscheduled. Now it's time to add Job details into Forms and upload some files that need to be attached to this Job. A quick look at a Calendar View, makes sure our activities are balanced between template, fab, and install. The green, blue and red default colors for Activities worked for our shop, but they're customizable to fit your process. The Map feature allows us to see which field crews are on Jobs, so they're not criss-crossing all over town. We like to print packets that go out with our different crews. There were default packets already created, and I made some Shop Tickets and Customer Surveys under Job Settings. I'll switch to a Job View to see what invoices need to go out today. Just like Calendar Views, Job Views can be saved, have filters applied, and I can choose which columns to display in the View. My office team is busy and the phone is ringing. So I'll pick up. It's a current customer checking in on the status of their Job. I can do a quick search. There they are. The Job Issue alerts me that something's up with their Job. With Systemize, anyone in the shop can look up a Job for an instant update. Time to check a Report of how the sales team is doing. In order to run a Report, I have to be recording that information somewhere in my database, like in the Job Details, Job Activities, or in a Form. Tailoring Systemize to fit our business model was straightforward. Settings houses all the options to customize Accounts, Calendars, Jobs, Users, Roles, and more. I can even look at previous invoices and update my credit card. When we have questions or need help, the Systemize Knowledge Base, with how-to articles and videos, is easily accessible. We can quickly contact a friendly Systemize expert with questions, or we can schedule a call by emailing support@moraware.com. Thanks for stopping by.",

      "content": "Video: Auto-Schedule TRANSCRIPT: Hi. Welcome to Systemize videos. This video will show you how to set up and use the Auto-Schedule feature. Auto-Schedule is used to automatically assign a date to an Activity based on the date of another Activity. Auto-Scheduled Activities can be manually adjusted in Jobs and will prevent unscheduled Activities. There are two parts to setting up Auto-Schedule. The Activity Status must be set to Auto-Schedule and a Dependency must also be created. Go to Settings, Job, Activity Types. If the Activity does not already exist, click on the Create button and add it. For existing Activities, click on the name of the Activity and select Auto-Schedule as the Status. Click on the Add Dependency button from the top. Select the Activity you just marked as Auto-Schedule. Next, you will select the Activity to schedule from, and if it should be before or after that Activity. In this example, I want Invoice to be Auto-Scheduled after Install by one workday. Uncheck \"Also Apply Reverse Dependency\" to prevent the Dependency running in both directions. Leave, \"Ignore For Auto-Schedule\" unchecked. If checked, you will receive a warning when a Dependency rule is violated, but does not have a date automatically assigned. Auto-Schedule Dependencies are assigned based on the work hours you set for your database. If you need help with setting workdays, work hours, and scheduling hours, check out \"Set Work Days And Work Hours On Calendar\" in the Systemize T. If the Dependency is set to some number of days after another Activity, it will show up in the first available work hour. If it's set up to some number of days before another Activity, it will be in the last available work hour. If it's set to start directly after another Activity, it shows up immediately afterward. If the Activity duration is blank Auto-Schedule scheduled it for 30 minutes by default. Let's look at Auto-Schedule Activities in a Job. I'll create a new Job from my standard Template, which includes the Invoice Activity. If you made a new Activity Type, you'll need to add that to your Job Template. The Systemize Knowledge Base has more details on Job Templates. More than one Activity is using Auto-Schedule, so I'll start by adding my Template date. All my Job Activities, have a date and will appear in Job views and on Calendars. I can manually change an Auto-Scheduled Activity here in the Job Details. If I change the Install date, I need to select a Status other than Auto-Schedule. Otherwise it will default back to the original date. This customer requested this Install date. So I'll mark it Confirmed. Any Activity scheduling off this one will automatically change, like Invoice. Drag and drop an Auto-Scheduled Activity in a Calendar View to change the date. Or click on an Activity date in a Job view to make changes. Check out the Systemized Knowledge Base for more articles and videos.

This video will show you how to create, edit and duplicate Roles. Every Systemize User must have a Role assigned to them. Assigning Roles gives Users the ability to do the work they need to do, avoids frustrating mistakes from accidental access, and keeps User views clear from clutter with items they don't use your need. Each User can have only one Role assigned to them. Any Role can be modified or deleted. And new Roles can be added. Take a few minutes to think about what different Users in your shop need to do. What tasks are similar, how were they different? This can help determine what rows are needed. And who they need to be assigned to. Let's begin with the Administrator Role. It may be tempting to make everyone an Admin, but that gives each and every User unlimited permissions in the database. Admin users are able to create and purchase additional Users, change passwords, and access the billing portal. Not everyone in your company may need that level of access. Let's take a look at the default Roles, then edit, duplicate and create a new Role. On the left click Settings. Users and Roles, Roles. Here you can quickly see each Role, a short description, and which Users are assigned to each. These built-in Roles are based on the most commonly assigned Roles our customers have told us about. Click on any Role name to view and edit the Permission details. There are a lot of Permissions each Role can have. So they're broken into groups. There are Permissions related to Accounts, CounterGo, Processes in this case, I have a Job Process and a Lead Process, Calendar, Reports, and Administration functions. Check or uncheck Permissions to allow or prevent that function. For example. I want Users with this Role to be able to read and update Jobs, but not create them. I'll uncheck Create. I also want Users with this Role to have the ability to create Views and run Reports. I'll scroll to Administration and give full control for Shared Saved Views and Reports. Full Control will allow a User to Create, Read, Update, and Delete that item. Create allows User to create that particular feature. Like create Accounts. Read means the future will be visible to the user. If you have users who don't need to view reports, uncheck the read option. Update allows for Users to make changes to a feature, but not necessarily create new ones. An example is the ability to update Job Forms, but not create new Forms. Delete gives Users with this Role, the ability to delete that feature like accounts, Jobs, Activities, Forms, and so on. You may have noticed that some groups have an Execute option. Execute is shown for tasks that require the User to do something that's outside of the database. Like emailing, CounterGo Quotes and Orders and API requests. I'm done making changes. So I'll save this Role. New Roles can be created by clicking on the Create button. Sometimes a new Role only requires a few changes, so it may be easier to Duplicate an existing Role and make edits. Let's do that now. Click on the name of the Role to copy, then click the Duplicate icon. Notice the name indicates it's a copy of the original. I'll change the name, make a couple of edits, and once I save, I have a new Role. Each role also has a Change Log, allowing you to view what changes have been made to the Role and who made them. These Roles are available to assign to new or existing Users. To change an existing Users' Role, go to Settings, Users and Roles, then Users. Click on any User Name and select a Role.

So if you need help with that, go to the Systemize knowledge base and search, Create Job Activity Types. When a Job is created, Activities are automatically added based on the Job Template used. If a Job is created without using a Template, Activities can be manually added by clicking the Add icon, and selecting a single Activity from the dropdown list or several using the Multiple button. Click on any Activity name to open it. Update the Status ,Start Date, Scheduled Time, Duration, Assignee, and Notes, if needed. It's a good idea to get in the habit of updating Activity Statuses in Systemize as tasks change in real time. A Job can only be completed, or closed, once all the Job Activities in the Job have a Status of complete or canceled. Click on any Activity name to make updates. Use the Complete Multiple icon to complete or cancel more than one Activity at the same time. Activities can also be scheduled from a Job or Calendar View. From a Job View, click on the underline date, or where it says \"No Date\", for any Activity. Changes made will be immediately visible in the Job View and updated in Job Details, and all other Job and Calendar Views. Let's look at scheduling and updating Activities from the Calendar. Click on any existing Activity to make edits. To add an unscheduled Job Activity from the Calendar, click on any open space, and select Insert Job Activity. Search for the Job Name and select it. Then click on an Activity to schedule. The Activity must already exist in the Job in order to schedule from the Calendar. If you need to update a few Activities at the same time, click on the Select Multiple icon. Then click on the activities to select them. Then click the Update Multiple icon to select a status.

This video will show you how to create. Edit and manage Job Activity Types. Most users refer to Job Activity Types, simply as Activities. They can include things related to sales, production steps, and follow up. Job Activities are the things that get assigned to a person or a piece of equipment, and will happen on a particular day and or time. It's best to update Activity Statuses as they change in real time to keep critical Job information current. Keeping Activities updated also allows you to complete Jobs and move them off the Calendar. In order for a Job to be considered complete in Systemize every Activity in the Job must have a Status of complete or canceled. So create new Activity Types, sparingly. Some of the most common Activities have already been created in your Systemize database. Many users don't add more, but they do customize certain features. Let's create an Activity and look at those features. Go to Settings, Job, Activity Types. Click on the Create New Activity Type button at the top. Enter the name of the Activity and the description if you'd like. By default, the new Activity is added to the Job Process. If you use more than one Process, like Leads, you can decide if the Activity needs to be available in that Process too. Now that the Activity is created, let's get it in the correct order before modifying other features. Click on any underlined number in the Sequence Column. Then click, hold, and drag to move the Activity higher or lower. This will determine where it appears in drop-down lists. I'll customize this Activity to save time later. Clicking on any Activity Name opens the Edit Activity Type dialog box. This is where I can select options that will automatically fill in when the Activity is created. Assigning a color is helpful for organizing Calendar Views. I plan to set up a dependency for this Activity so that it automatically schedules off of another Activity. I'll select Auto-Schedule as the Status. For more information on dependencies visit the Systemize Knowledge Base. If an Activity usually takes about the same amount of time set a Duration. Setting an estimated Duration helps when scheduling your crews and machinery. And when using the Auto-Schedule feature. The Activity Duration can always be manually changed in any Job. The Activity I created is usually assigned to one person in my shop. So I'll select their name now. Each time this Activity is created in a Job, it will automatically be assigned to them. And it can be manually changed in any Job. If there are Activities that are no longer being used, click on the Activity Name, then check Inactivate. This will keep the Activity associated with previous Jobs, but prevent its use going forward. Job Activities can be added to Job Templates. When a Job's created from a Job Template, those Activities will automatically be added. Visit the Systemize Knowledge Base for more on creating and using Job Templates. If you need help scheduling Activities, watch the Schedule and Update Job Activities. Video.

      "content": "What’s New: Moraware Recap Fall 2024 TRANSCRIPT: Hi, I'm Chelsea. Wondering what we've been doing behind the screen? Our development team is consistently working to update Moraware Systemize, Inventory, and CounterGo to provide you with the best experience for managing your business. From keeping your system secure, managing larger jobs, and making it easier to use Moraware products, here's a quick recap of just a few of the most recent feature updates. Let's start with an important topic, no matter what Moraware product you use. We've enhanced the security of your database and information with Two Factor Authentication at login. Enabling the feature is not required, but highly recommended since it's the best way to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Systemize Phases are a helpful way to break up larger Jobs and schedule smaller blocks of work separately. When viewing Job Details, the new Phase Filter option allows for selecting and viewing all Activities, Forms, Orders, and uploaded Files related to the Phase or Phases selected. This means less scrolling and easier visibility of only the information you need. For Systemize users who also use Moraware Inventory, recent enhancements allow for Serial Numbers to be searched to find specific slabs easier. Three new features in CounterGo make it easier to quote larger Jobs. Line item only Quotes Without Drawings can now be created. Quotes Without Drawings are helpful to quickly total square footage, especially when a drawing and measurements have already been provided. Square feet, or measurements, along with Curves, Bump outs, Splash, Edge, Sinks, and Cutouts can all quickly be added without creating a Drawing. CounterGo now has the option to create one drawing and then multiply the Quantities of the area in Step 6, making it faster to create multi-unit Quotes that use the same countertop layouts. Page Breaks can now be added to the Drawing Area when printing Quotes, making it easier to read larger or more complex layouts. This feature works best when printed or emailed with a Quote & Order form that has the Drawing Area set to the full width, like the built-in Quote With Large Drawing Form. Additional Countergo improvements were released to make Quoting and Drawing easier and more intuitive. Starting with Pan and Zoom when drawing, keyboard arrow shortcuts have been added when using the Pan feature. Use the Shift key and the mouse to Pan without selecting it from the side menu. Zoom now anchors to the center of the drawing space and works using a magic mouse, mouse with a scroll wheel, two finger touch on a trackpad, or keyboard plus and minus shortcuts. Waterfall and Miters can now be applied to non standard edges.Those that are segmented have bump outs or bump ins, notched or clipped corners. As with standard waterfalls and miters, the amount of Material required, as well as a charge for the two cuts between the pieces, is automatically calculated.

Before you begin, be clear on how you are going to name Jobs and Accounts. It doesn't matter what approach you take for naming Jobs and Accounts, but do it the same way every time and make sure anyone entering Jobs does it the same way.Accounts can be builders, dealers, individual homeowners, or whatever groupings you used before. If you work with builders or dealers, create Accounts for those builders or dealers and assign individual Jobs to them.We recommend creating an Account for every standalone Job, like individual homeowners. It will make Reporting, managing Contacts and creating mailing lists easier. Or, standalone Jobs can be assigned to one Account like \"Homeowner\" or \"Retail\". If your database is new, you will need to create Accounts when you create Jobs. Once they are entered they can be used for any future Job. Click on Jobs > +Create > enter the name of the Job. Click the More button by the Account field. To create a new Account click the Add icon > type in an Account Name > Save.If the Account already exists, start typing it in, or use the Search button to pull it up. In the Job Detail page for the new Job, click the Edit icon to the right of Job Info and add information that is important to the way you do business. Click the Edit icon in the Job Address field to enter the Job site address.Click the Edit icons across from Account Address and Account Contacts to save that information to the Account.

You should choose the option that seems best for your workflow - don't try to use both. OPTION 1: JOB ISSUE WITH A CATEGORY Create a new Job Issue with the Category of \"Change Order\". See Related Articles for the steps to make a new Job Issue Category. Add the Job Category Display Field to your Calendar View and now you can see your Job Issue on the Calendar. And you can create a Job View to filter jobs by Job Issue Category. Save that View so you can review it daily. OPTION 2: LIST OF VALUES FIELD IN A JOB FORM Add a field to one of your Job Forms. You can then display that new Field on your Calendar.Note: You can't display a checkbox field on your Calendar. You can also create a Job View that will list all of your Jobs that require that change order. You can review that list daily and work to bring it to zero - so that all change orders have been completed.",

Field Width can be confusing when you are selecting your options. Field Width is always relative to how many other Fields are in the same row. For example, if you have two fields in one row, and each is set to \"1\" in the Field Width box, they will each be given the same amount of space. If one of those fields is set to \" 2\" for Field Width, then it will take up 2 times as much space as all the other Fields in that row.",

ASSIGNEES: does not necessarily log in to the system to create or schedule Jobs. They need to see information about work assigned to them, or update information like Job Status for an Activity. An Assignee is designated to an Activity and can appear on the Calendar, like people's names, teams or even equipment such as \"Install Truck 1\". Assignees do not have Roles, and there is no charge for the number of Assignees you create and use. When an Assignee is no longer needed, they can be inactivated, preventing them from being assigned to future work but preserving a record of Activities they were assigned to. USERS: log into the database to create, edit and schedule Jobs and Activities. They also may create and edit Forms and run Reports. Users need to have the ability to make changes to information in the database. Users have Roles, so their access and privileges can be modified based on what work they need to do in the system. Each subscription comes with a certain number of Users included, additional Users above that number are an additional charge. See the Systemize Pricing page for more information.

Go to Settings > Job > Templates. Look at the Process Column. If it does not say \"Yes\", then the Template is not available for that Process. In the example below, the Standard Job Template is not available for either the Lead or Job Process. Let's make it available for the Job Process. Look at the Activity Types and Forms used for the Template and note which are included. Now let's check to see if each of those is included in the Process you are trying to use. The next step is to check you Job Activities to make sure each Activity in the Template is set to \"Yes\" for that Process. Go to Settings > Job > Activity Types. Look at the Process column for each Activity that is in the Template you are trying to use. In this example Invoice is set to No, but it is an Activity included in the Job Template. To allow that Activity Type for the Job process, click the underlined No and confirm to Add it to the Job Process. Go to Settings > Job > Job Forms.

When owners or managers make the results visible and reward the team for progress, they've been able to reduce errors and make more money. This process has worked well for many Users. It involves two steps and you may want to upload our pre-made Rework Form which you can customize. Click on the Rework Form to open it in a new window, then download via your web browser Save As or Print as PDF functions. Or right click with your mouse to Save As. Rework-Form.xml Steps for downloading and importing a Form Click or right-click on the blue underlined \"Rework- Form.xml\" above and choose Save Link As. If you didn't get to choose where the file was saved on your computer, you will want to find it before you try to import the file into Systemize. Check your Downloads folder or Search your computer. In Systemize, go to Settings > Job > Job Forms. At the top next to Process click Job. Click +Create at the top. Click the Import Job Form icon. Click Choose File to Upload and find your saved .xml file. Click Import. Edit the Form as needed. STEP 1: REMAKE THE COUNTERTOP Create a Phase called \"Rework kitchen\" or \"Rework splash\". Add the Job Activities you'll need to fix the problem. For example, if the splash broke in transit but was the correct size, then you don't need to Template again. You might just add Fabrication and Install. Schedule the Rework Phase Activities. Add a new Area Detail Job Form or the Form you use to track the details about your Jobs. Assign the Form to the Remake Phase. Enter the square feet and other details you need. Check the box to indicate that this square footage is a Remake so you can filter out the number from your monthly reports. Note: If your Area Details form does not have a Remake checkbox, you can edit your Forms to add one. The Activities for the Remake Splash can be displayed on your Calendar with only the square feet for the remake, rather than the whole Job. STEP 2: TRACK DETAILS Create an \"Error-Tracking\" or \"Rework\" Form that is used to record details about the error. Or use the sample Form at the top of this page. In this example, there are areas to record details about the problem, who was involved, who approved the rework, what material was involved, etc. When there's some kind of mistake on a Job, the appropriate person should add the Rework form to the Job and complete the details. If the form requires approvals from different people within the company, you'll want to create a Job View or Report for those people to see that approval is needed. The view might look something like this: Create a Report to show you Jobs with the Rework form attached. If you create a Report with the essential information from your Rework form selected as your Display Fields, you can easily export the Report into Excel for further analysis.",

Applying a reverse Dependency allows for the Activity being Auto-Scheduled to be the scheduler. Reverse Dependencies mean that it will apply in both directions, for example, from Template to Install AND Install to Template. Similar behavior can be accomplished by applying more than one Dependency to an Activity, using a combination of before and after dependency types. EXAMPLE WITH THREE ACTIVITIES Activity 2 happens five days after Activity 1. Activity 3 happens five days after Activity 2. The dependencies for the Activities look like this:Also apply reverse dependency and Ignore for Auto-Schedule are NOT checked. BEHAVIOR WITHOUT REVERSE DEPENDENCIES SCENARIO 1 Enter a date for Activity 1 and both Activity 2 and 3 have a date assigned automatically. SCENARIO 2 Enter a date for Activity 2 then Activity 3 will have a date auto assigned based on the dependency, but Activity 1 will remain empty. SCENARIO 3 Enter a date for Activity 3: Install and Activity 1 and 2 remain empty. WITH REVERSE DEPENDENCIES Reverse dependencies allow for interconnected activities to schedule forward or backward. Usually the Activity 1 date is entered first, and the other two schedule automatically. Occasionally, the other dates are decided first and the behavior needs to work backwards. SCENARIO 1 Using the same Activities above, apply reverse dependency to Activity 2 and change the status of Activity 1 to Auto-Schedule. Enter a date for either Activity 1 or 2 and all three dates will populate. SCENARIO 2 Apply reverse dependency to Activity 2, to Activity 3, and change the status of Activity 1 to Auto-Schedule.

      "content": "Use Consistent Activity Types In general, we discourage fabricators from creating separate Activity Types for different kinds of Jobs. For example, you might think it's a good idea to create \"Retail Install\" and \"Builder Install\", or \"Natural Stone Template\" and \"Natural Stone Fabrication\" as separate Activities from \"SS Template\" and \"SS Fabrication.\" It's not usually a good idea, and we discuss why below. We've worked with thousands of fabricators, and each one is different. If you'd like to talk through your work flow, email support@moraware.com to set up a few minutes to talk. One advantage of working with Systemize is that you can display the total square feet for different Activities on the top of each day in Calendar Views. Many fabricators find this feature useful for capacity planning. If you have several different types of Activities, however, you will have different totals at the top of each day, which may be confusing. Reports can only be run on one Activity at a time. For example, if you want to generate a Report on Jobs based on Install Activities, how many square feet installed per week for the last 6 month, you would only be able to run a Report on one type of Install at a time, and then add the numbers manually. You might also find the Job Views less useful if you have several separate columns for each type of an Activity, reducing the usefulness of the overall view.",

Adding the new Order Area Form to existing Activity Packets allows for printing the Order Area information pulled from a Quote directly in printed packets. If you rely on Reports to track things like the total square footage installed per month, we recommend duplicating that Report and modifying it to calculate square footage from the Order Area Details until you are creating all Jobs from Orders.

A Process is most commonly used to track Sales separate from production. Creating another Process will allow you to track particular activities and information separate from active Jobs. When a new Process is created, a menu item will appear in the left side navigation menu. Activities, Forms and Job Fields can be created and associated with that Process.For example, a Sales Lead Process could contain Activities like Sales Call and E-mail, plus a Lead Field called Lead Source. After adding a Process, like a Lead, new Leads are created in the same manner new Jobs are created. When it's time for a Sales Lead to become a Job, a single button click converts the Lead to a Job.Once a Job, you can access the full history, including previous Sales Lead Activities, Forms and Fields. Process security access is shared with Job security access. A User with access to edit Activities in Jobs can also edit Activities in Leads.

The Shop Users feature is designed to simplify a User's View and track the time they spend on Job Activities, not for use as a time clock for payroll purposes. Shop Users can be added at any time and are the same cost as regular users. See our Systemize Pricing Page homepage for current pricing. BEFORE ADDING A SHOP USER: Create the Activity Types to track. Create Shop Views that show the flow of work through the shop. Identify who will fix problems with any Jobs that get started or stopped accidentally. Ideally this will be the shop manager. Shop users can ONLY click Start and Stop. If Start or Stop is clicked accidentally, a Systemize user with the correct permissions will need to fix the Status of the Activity.

      "content": "Change Login Location Settings In Systemize Intended to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, Login Locations are based on IP Addresses. When set up incorrectly, it can prevent your entire organization from accessing your data. We highly recommended that only the person responsible for IT infrastructure manage location-based security if you need to use it. The User option \"Login from anywhere\" overrides a user being included in a Login Location restriction. For example, if a User named 'Buddy' is added to a Login Location called 'Office Only', and Buddy's User account has Login from anywhere checked, Buddy can still log in from anywhere, regardless of being included in the Login Location list. Edit the User Buddy and uncheck Login from anywhere. Considerations before setting up Login Locations: If your office does not have a static IP address, meaning it can change, it is very dangerous and unwise to use location-based security. If a location of 'Office Only' is defined and properly implemented, only users who log in from your office network will be allowed access. Mobile devices, home access, coffee shop access will all be denied, UNLESS a VPN (virtual private network) is set up so remote users can securely connect to the office network, then connect to Moraware. Identify which users should be restricted to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. Login Location is driven off of IP addresses ranges. Users must be selected for Login Location rules to apply - an empty list of Users means NO users fall under the location restrictions. Go to Settings > System > Login Locations and click +Create at the top of the page. Name the location and click the Multiple icon to select the Users restricted to this Login Location rule. Enter a single IP address or a range and Save. Go to Settings > Users & Roles > Users For each User on the list of restricted Login Locations, confirm restrictions are in effect by inspecting the Login From column in the User list.",

Administrator Role: allows the User complete access, including creating/purchasing additional Users, changing passwords and accessing the Moraware billing portal. The Admin Role can be assigned to more than one User but it's not a good idea to make everyone an Admin. If you want to give a User the ability to do just about everything, use a Role like Full User + Settings. Built-in Roles: there are some Roles already created to get started right away. These Roles are based on the most commonly assigned Roles our customers have told us about. Any Role can be edited or deleted. Note: If you upgraded from JobTracker to Systemize, you won't see any of the built-in Roles. Your original Roles transferred over, and you can always create new Roles. In JobTracker you could assign more than one Role to a User. In Systemize, each User can have only one Role. Users who were previously assigned multiple Roles will still have them, but any edits going forward will require they only have one. Go to Settings > Users & Roles > Roles and click the Create icon. Enter a name for the Role and a description to be able to see at a glance what the Role does or does not include. In each area check the box for the level of permission you want to grant the Role.Full Control will allow a User to Create, Read, Update, and Delete that item. Otherwise select each permission individually.Execute is shown for tasks that require the User to do something that is outside the database, like emailing and API requests.In this example, the Role will allow a User to create and update Jobs, but not delete them. It also allows a User to see the Calendar and create and update Appointments, not Job Activities. Leave all of the Administration boxes unchecked and any User with this Role will not be able to edit any Settings. If you want the user to be able to see the Add Additional Item option in a drop-down list in a Form, check the box for Job Settings. Save the Role then assign it to a User.",

External Users cannot view Calendar Appointments since Appointments are not associated with a Job or Account.

The following steps must be taken to create External Users: Create External View(s) Create Role Create User(s) CREATE EXTERNAL JOB & CALENDAR VIEWS Save both Job Views and Calendar Views with the options you want the External User to see. Do NOT limit the view to a specific Account. Account access is defined when creating the External User. To allow all External Users to view the same type of information, create one External View with no Account filter. Use the Options button when viewing Jobs or Calendars to define the desired View Filters and Display Fields. Click the Views icon from the top menu then click the Save icon. Select External View > Type in Name for the View > Save. CREATE AN EXTERNAL ROLE Go to Settings > Users & Roles > External Roles. Click the +Create button to make a new role. Type a name (i.e. 'Dealers') and select the Job Page and Calendar Page Views you created for this External Role. CREATE AN EXTERNAL USER Go to Settings > Users & Roles > External Users Click the +Create button. Enter user information:User Name - the name the external user will log in with. Password - assign the password, if you want the user to change the password when they login for the first time, check the \"Must Change Password\" box further down.

      "content": "Track Sales Leads In Systemize Overview When Do You Start Tracking Customers in Systemize? Most of our customers initially start entering customer information into Systemize the moment they start working on a new Job. They win the business and then enter the new information as a Job. All of the relevant Activities needed to perform the work are managed until the Job is successfully completed. Enabling the built-in leads Process allows for potential customer information to be entered and tracked, providing a record of what was discussed and when, or who to follow up with, before it the potential work becomes a Job. Can Your Sales Process Get More Efficient? Many customers ask about taking advantage of Systemize earlier in their business process. They use Systemize as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool to track sales leads and schedule follow up sales activities. Using the Systemize Lead Process can make your sales process more efficient and actionable, and allows you to track customers and prospects, and all of the associated history and future Activities. Keep track of who you talked to, when, and about what, over many years. Does your Company have a Sales Process? Regardless of size, pretty much every company in every industry does a series of actions to get new business. All companies perform tasks related to sales that are much more effective if tracked and scheduled. Systemize can track those sales activities, tie them to a Lead, which can then be converted to a Job upon making the sale. The beauty of this conversion is that Jobs retain sales history, so it’s no longer just about tracking template to install, but really knowing that customer, their preferences, and their behavior during the sales process. And perhaps best of all, unlike having to pay hundreds of dollars per month for a separate CRM application, sales lead tracking is included at no additional charge with your Systemize subscription. The Leads Process is built into every Systemize database and can be turned on at any time, allowing for you to incorporate Systemize in the process you use to track interactions and follow-ups with prospective customers.",

If you do nothing, we'll delete your data 30 days after you cancel. Backups of that data are deleted on a rolling basis shortly after that. OPTIONS FOR KEEPING YOUR DATA The simplest and cheapest thing to do is to create \"wide\" Views of all Accounts and all Jobs and then copy/paste those to Excel or Google sheets. This will get you the most important customer and Job information quickly and easily. Export your Contacts. Hire an outside developer to write software with the Systemize API that transfers your Account and Job information, including files, to your new system.

      "content": "Multiple Databases For Multiple Shop Locations Do you have more than one location or database? Fabricators with more than one location use Systemize in different ways depending on physical location and organizational structure. If they share resources - perhaps they fabricate from the same shop or they share programming staff - they usually set up one single Systemize database. If they operate each location as separate companies and do not need employees from one location to see Job information at the other location, then they set up separate Systemize databases. If you currently have two databases and are looking to merge, there's no good way to combine the two databases to move forward. The best practice is to choose which database to close. Make a wide Job View with columns of all necessary information, then copy and paste into a spreadsheet like Excel or Sheets to keep any important information you'll need later. Let us know when you are ready to turn that database off. No two shops operate exactly the same, so if you have questions, email our Systemize experts, support@moraware.com, to talk through the best approach. ADVANTAGES OF SHARING ONE SYSTEMIZE DATABASE It will be easier to schedule shared resources like Programming Staff or Inventory. Sharing information between locations will be easier, everyone can look at the same Job information. You will be able to Report on your company as a whole. Training your staff and documenting policies will be easier because the systems will be identical. DISADVANTAGES OF SHARING ONE SYSTEMIZE DATABASE No way to limit or restrict one location from seeing Jobs or Accounts from the other location. If you're using Moraware Inventory, you have to rethink your Inventory process to ensure that everyone understands how to view slabs at their own location. In order to make the two location process work, users would need to be diligent about selecting Location in the Job Info dialog box after creating a new Job.",

Save the Report by clicking on the Save As button at the top of the page. Additional Fields can be added, but adding more detail adds rows. For example, if you add Job Name, you'll change the report into a subtotal of the Square Feet for each Job within each week, which is a very different. Click Report > + Create > Click on the Edit Measure button.Select for your Measure: Number of Jobs.Select by Time Field: Job Creation DateClick Save. Click Apply. Now click on the Options button at the top of the Report. Click On the More button on the far right on the Measure line. Select \"Job Form\" as the Subject Area.

NOTE: if your form doesn't have numeric values, you won't be able to use it in this way. Click Save. The Time Field is subtle but important to understand. If you want to report on installs within a certain time period, then you choose Install Date as the time field. If there's more than one install activity in a job, we need to know which one you want to use.If you're making a weekly report, and a Job has an Activity on Friday and another on Monday, in which week do you want to include the square footage for that Job? If you want that Job in the previous week, choose First in Job; if you want it in the later week, choose Last in Job. If you want to break the square footage down by phases, then choose First in Phase or Last in Phase but recognize that makes things gets more complicated.

      "content": "Reporting Basics Reports are simply another way of getting information out of Systemize - a way of asking your database questions about your Jobs. Yes, you can also answer questions with filtered Job Views and Calendar Views. A Job View gives you a list of Jobs that meet specific criteria. For example, \"show me all Jobs that have Issues that are Active or Urgent,\" or \"Show me all Jobs that are ready to Invoice.\" A Calendar View gives you a list of Activities that meet specific criteria - and then arranges those Activities on the screen based on when they are scheduled. For example, \"Show me all the template Activities that are assigned to Astrid over the next 7 days,\" or \"Show me all the Install Activities for today that are Assigned to George or Mario.\"Note : a Calendar View will never show you Activities that have NOT been scheduled. Use the AutoSchedule feature to make sure you don't have unscheduled Activities. Reports are used to count something across Jobs and Activities. For example, you might want to know \"How many square feet did we Install per Month over the last year?\" or \"How many Jobs did we complete by Salesperson per week this year?\" It is important to remember that while Reports are a powerful tool, they can only count one thing at a time. Ask yourself, what do you want to count or add as you create your Report. Reports can be hard to master, they’re very flexible and powerful, but that makes them more complex too. Don’t hesitate to call us for help – but remember that it sometimes takes us a while to figure out difficult reports, too! RUN A SAVED REPORT To view an existing Report, click Reports from the left side navigation menu, then click on the saved Report you want to view. Now a Report is displayed in the main Reports window. MODIFY & SAVE AN EXISTING REPORT As with Job Views and Calendar Views, you can then click the Options button to customize and then save the Report by clicking on the Save As icon at the top of the page to save your changes. To create one of our Sample Reports, start in the Report Options window. The sample reports listed in our Related Articles below will show you what settings you need to select in this window to create the Reports on your system.

Just like Jobs, Phases can have multiples of the same Activity. Sometimes these Activities take place in different months. Using First In Phase or Last In Phase is how to designate which month to put the totals in, when there are multiples of the same Activity in each Phase. Selecting First in Phase will put the totals for the Phase on the date when the first of the same Activity happens. Selecting Last in Phase will put the totals for the Phase on the date when the last of the same Activity happens. Let's take a look at a sample Job that has two Phases, and two Install Activities in each Phase. Phase 1 has both Activities completed in the same month. Phase 2 has one Activity completed in one month, one in the next month. Selecting First in Phase in the example below would put the square feet Installed on April 11 for Phase 1 and April 25 for Phase 2. Selecting Last in Phase in the example below would put the square feet Installed on April 18 for Phase 1 and May 2 for Phase 2.",

      "content": "Display Calendar On Large Screen Or Workstation Maximizing the value of Systemize means making current job information widely available. One way to accomplish this is via large displays in the office and fabrication shop, or a touchscreen workstation in the shop. Note: This article contains technical jargon that is unavoidable. If the technospeak is foreign to you, share it with the nearest techie person. If you don't already know a techie person, you may need to hire a consultant. Examples from Moraware Customers Example: auto-refreshing shop view and shop calendar on flat-screen TVs Setup Instructions A. Choose a Calendar View Choose the Calendar View you wish to display.WARNING: Be sure the define the view with Auto-Refresh enabled. Determine if you can use an existing user or need to create a new Systemize user. To mirror a tab on a TV via Chromecast, use an existing user in a separate browser tab.Instructions: Setting up Chromecast tab mirroring Note: This option is fragile - if the computer is turned off or the browser tab is closed, the display will lose its data feed. A smart TV or a web-enabled USB device plugged into a TV/LCD requires a separate user (incurs an additional monthly charge per user). Create a new JobTracker user named something like \"shop_display\" and provide read-only security access for calendar viewing. Note: Creating a new JobTracker user requires administrator rights. See your administrator if you lack the Admin>Users menu item. B. Configure the TV / large display There are four different ways to configure the display of Systemize on a large screen. Select the one best suited to your environment. Direct Monitor Connection from an existing computer Involves an HDMI cable connecting a computer and the TV (must be close enough to reach the display) Wireless Connection to a SMART Television A Smart TV is one that has wifi capability and a browser built-in. Use the TV remote, open the TV browser, enter <yourcompany>.moraware.net into the browser, log in and then navigate to the calendar view. Google Chromecast tab mirroring Instructions: Setting up Chromecast tab mirroring USB / Stick computer plugged into a non-smart TV All three of these devices runs as a standard-alone computer plugged into the HDMI port on a non-smart TV. The TV functions as the computer's display. Suggested USB Windows Stick Suggested ChromeboxAnother affordable solution is to set up a small workstation in the shop. Prices for touch screen all-in-one computers have fallen so explore if this is an option for your shop. The example below is set up on a metal cart in the shop area, has a touch screen and the keyboard is flat, flexible and has no crevices for dust and debris.",

However, it is possible to capture signatures via a tablet running a third-party app, then attach the signature image file to the Job or Quote. When storing signatures in Systemize, a good idea is to create a File Type of \"Signature\". Job Well Done integrates tightly with Systemize and is focused on helping your people in the field on Jobs. Job Well Done does a lot more than signatures, but capturing signatures is built in. Search your app store for a PDF app that captures signatures. If you have technically savvy people, they may be able to capture the signature using such an app and then upload it manually into Moraware. Some specific apps that Moraware customers have tried: SignEasy for iPad search for \"SignEasy\" in the app store, install it, test it, and make an account.Once SignEasy is installed, go back to CounterGo and print a Quote as a PDF. You'll see an option at the top of the screen to \"Open in SignEasy\". Sometimes you have to tap near the top of the screen to make that option reappear. Have the customer sign it, use \"2nd party\" and/or \"3rd party\" signatures so that they're not saved, and email YOU a copy. Once that's done, you'll see an email icon that you can tap again to email the customer a copy. SignDoc for Mobile Windows. In order to upload it right from a tablet, you'll need to use a Windows device like a Surface Pro. Android apps https://www.hellosign.com/",

Eliminate unnecessary extra orders. Have Slabs and Sinks tied to Jobs. Make sure what is ordered matches what is received. Keep everything in one place, providing visibility and transparency. Know the date Slabs are ordered, received, and used. There are two primary groups of fabricators that use Moraware Inventory. On Demand users only order material once a Job is confirmed.

Open the Job, click in the Material column and select Add Slab From Inventory. I’ll filter for Desert Dream Granite, refresh the view, and allocate the remaining half slab.

      "content": "What’s New: Moraware Recap Fall 2024 TRANSCRIPT: Hi, I'm Chelsea. Wondering what we've been doing behind the screen? Our development team is consistently working to update Moraware Systemize, Inventory, and CounterGo to provide you with the best experience for managing your business. From keeping your system secure, managing larger jobs, and making it easier to use Moraware products, here's a quick recap of just a few of the most recent feature updates. Let's start with an important topic, no matter what Moraware product you use. We've enhanced the security of your database and information with Two Factor Authentication at login. Enabling the feature is not required, but highly recommended since it's the best way to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Systemize Phases are a helpful way to break up larger Jobs and schedule smaller blocks of work separately. When viewing Job Details, the new Phase Filter option allows for selecting and viewing all Activities, Forms, Orders, and uploaded Files related to the Phase or Phases selected. This means less scrolling and easier visibility of only the information you need. For Systemize users who also use Moraware Inventory, recent enhancements allow for Serial Numbers to be searched to find specific slabs easier. Three new features in CounterGo make it easier to quote larger Jobs. Line item only Quotes Without Drawings can now be created. Quotes Without Drawings are helpful to quickly total square footage, especially when a drawing and measurements have already been provided. Square feet, or measurements, along with Curves, Bump outs, Splash, Edge, Sinks, and Cutouts can all quickly be added without creating a Drawing. CounterGo now has the option to create one drawing and then multiply the Quantities of the area in Step 6, making it faster to create multi-unit Quotes that use the same countertop layouts. Page Breaks can now be added to the Drawing Area when printing Quotes, making it easier to read larger or more complex layouts. This feature works best when printed or emailed with a Quote & Order form that has the Drawing Area set to the full width, like the built-in Quote With Large Drawing Form. Additional Countergo improvements were released to make Quoting and Drawing easier and more intuitive. Starting with Pan and Zoom when drawing, keyboard arrow shortcuts have been added when using the Pan feature. Use the Shift key and the mouse to Pan without selecting it from the side menu. Zoom now anchors to the center of the drawing space and works using a magic mouse, mouse with a scroll wheel, two finger touch on a trackpad, or keyboard plus and minus shortcuts. Waterfall and Miters can now be applied to non standard edges.Those that are segmented have bump outs or bump ins, notched or clipped corners. As with standard waterfalls and miters, the amount of Material required, as well as a charge for the two cuts between the pieces, is automatically calculated. The last CounterGo feature to highlight is the ability to add the Total Price as a Display Column in Quote Views. We're pleased to have added these new product features and updates to provide you with an improved Moraware experience. If you have any questions, reach out to our friendly Moraware Support Team at support@moraware.com.Thanks for stopping by!",

If one Field is set to 2, it will be twice as wide as a Field set to 1, and so on. Hide Field When Blank: when checked, this option will not print the Field if it is empty. Cell: refers to the entire Field, both the Label and the Value. The Cell has unique properties related to where the Label appears, across the top of the value, on the left or right, or not at all. It can have a border all the way around the entire Cell, and also an inner border to split the Label from the Value. Leave any or all options blank to use the default settings. Label: refers to the Name of the Field, like \"Material\". Select the Font, Font Style (Bold, Underlined, Italic), Text Color, and Background. Leave any or all options blank to use the default settings. Value: refers to the unique information from your database. In the Label Form, it will appear empty, since each Value is pulled for each item being labeled. For the example of a Field named \"Material\", the Value that will appear when printed will be whatever Material has been selected for each item, like Granite. Select the Font, Font Style (Bold, Underlined, Italic), Text Color, and Background. Leave any or all options blank to use the default settings.
