This video will introduce you to how CounterGo works, how to get started, and where to find answers if you have questions, so you can start quoting right away. The quickest way to learn CounterGo is to start making Quotes.It doesn't matter if you use real or practice info. You always have the option to delete practice Quotes later. Creating Quotes will help you understand the fundamentals. Then you can decide how to tailor CounterGo to your specific needs. There are three main topics. This video will cover.First, we'll look at Price Lists. This is where Quotes get the numbers to calculate Quote totals. Next, we'll set up a Quote Form, which you'll need to print or email Quotes to your customers.Finally, we'll draw a quick Quote.Let's take a look at the Price List so you know where to find it and what it contains. When you're making your first Quotes, you don't need to have the Price List filled in.Any Quote can be manually updated in Step Six, so don't worry about filling in every item right away. From the left hand menu, click on Price List. Notice that one list is already enabled. Each CounterGo, Quote, can only pull from one Price List at a time, even if you have multiple Price Lists.Price Lists are independent of each other, so each one must be updated manually if you need to make changes.We recommend adding all of your pricing into one list to start. You can apply discounts, set up automatic Account discounts, or manually adjust prices in Step Six.Once you complete one Price List, duplicate it, and make changes. This will save time, if you do need to create and manage more than one Price List. If you work in metric, pause this video and watch the Price Lists Video: Use Metric Settings & Price Lists before continuing.There's a link to it below this video.Click on Retail, then Edit Price List. Now click on Materials. This is where you're going to enter all of the Materials you use in your business. Your database already has some default Materials loaded.Click Delete Material to remove any you don't use. Click Add Material at the top to enter new products. From the dropdown menu, you'll see a list of Material available to add.If a Material you use is not listed, choose Add Custom Material instead. Type in all of the information, then add Colors for that product, one name per line. Set the default Slab Size. You can change this in individual Quotes or for particular Colors later. By default, Allow Other Color, Allow Discount, and Editable Price On Quote are checked.These options allow you to add a one-time Other Color manually in a Quote, apply discounts to this Material, or manually adjust the price in Step Six of a Quote. We recommend leaving them checked as you begin. You always have the option to come back to the Price List and change these options later.There are some default Colors loaded. Add or delete Colors, just be sure there's only one name per line.Let's talk pricing. CounterGo can price by the Slab square footage or by the countertop square footage. If pricing by the entire Slab, you'll want to change your Colors to be priced by the Slab.Calculate the price per square foot for the total Slab and enter that number. If pricing by the countertop square footage, then leave as is and enter the price you charge. There's a helpful article, Convert Slab Costs To Square Foot Price, or Convert Slab Costs To Square Meter Price, in our knowledge base if you need tips calculating Slab pricing. Those articles are also linked below this video.In each Material. You can also create Price Groups to group Colors together and apply a price to all of the Colors within the group at one time. Using Price Groups is a quick way to update your pricing. Let's move to Fabrication and Installation.If you have separate Installation and Fabrication charges, enable Installation here in order for that charge to appear when Quoting. Add your retail price for Fabrication and or Installation in the boxes. Specific Fabrication and Installation charges can be added for specific Materials. We have step-by-step info on that in the knowledge base.For now, you can edit the price manually in Step Six, as long as Editable Price On Quote is checked.All right, we've got our Material, Fabrication, and Installation set. Those are the essentials. Go through the remainder of the Price List when you can, and add in your prices. If there are things you don't charge for, enter zero. Before you exit, make sure to save or all your changes will be lost. Time to set up a Quote Form. You'll use Quote Forms to print or email Quotes to your customers, and there's lots of ways to customize them. Head over to Settings, Quote & Order, then Forms. There are a few default Templates provided. Let's begin with the Form Template call",

Welcome to Drawing Your Countertops. Log in to your CounterGo database. Start a new Quote or open an existing one. To create your countertop pieces, click, hold, and drag your cursor in the blank canvas area. Let’s draw an L-shaped piece, a smaller piece, and an island. Resize a countertop by clicking and holding on an edge to move it. Or, click on the dimension and enter the exact number. If you click Save & Next Edge, you can enter all the dimensions for this piece in this one box. Move pieces around by clicking and holding inside the shape and move to the position you want. Click once on any piece to Rotate, Duplicate, or Delete the Counter. Let’s add some text to this Quote to label that a stove slides into this space. From the right side navigation click the Text box, then, click anywhere in the Drawing space and enter the text to display. Click and hold on the Text to move it. Click once, for a menu to Edit, Duplicate, or make the text Larger or Smaller. Let’s move to Step2 Curves & Bumpouts to modify corners and counter pieces. All corners are abbreviated “Standard”. CounterGo assumes every corner is standard, or square, unless you tell it otherwise. Click on any corner for a submenu of options to apply. The options will vary slightly depending on if you are clicking on an inside or outside corner. Click on a counter edge for a pop-up menu of options to select. Add a bump-in along the inside edge of the L-shaped counter. Click on the edge and select Add Bump-In from the menu. Enter the Depth and Width and select squared, or angled edges. Position the Bump-in in the Center of the counter, or offset it from the Left or Right. Moving to the island, let’s give one edge a Full Radius. To change any of the corners or shaping features, click on the corner or feature dimension, select the current dimension, and make your edit. Time to add some Splashes and designate which Edges are finished. Click on Step 3. All the edges are marked “F”. CounterGo assumes every edge is finished unless you tell it otherwise. Here in Step 3, you’ll only be indicating if an edge is finished, unfinished, or a flat cut and polish. Later in Step 5, you’ll designate which finished edge should be applied. Click on a side edge and select Unfinished. The edges on either side of the slide-in stove will have a flat cut and polish, which we call an Appliance edge in CounterGo. If you’re wondering what AdditionalFinishedEdge is for, it is part of a two-step process to add more than one kind of edge finish to a countertop. Check out the Waterfall& Multiple Edges video to go through the steps in detail. Click on a counter edge that will have a Splash. Select from the presets or choose “Other Splash” to add a custom splash height. Click on another edge to add a Splash. In the pop-up menu, the splash height you applied most recently is at the top. Move to Step 4 to add Sink and Cooktopcutouts to your counters. Click on any countertop and note the new options. You can add a Sink Model, a Sink Cutout, or a Cooktop Cutout to display in the countertop. Click on the counter and select SinkCutout. Enter the type, shape, dimensions, and faucet count. If you select Show Centerline, you’ll see the distance from the left or right edge of the counter to the center of the sink. I want to show a centerline on this cutout, to help me position it properly. Click and hold on the sink to move it. The centerline dimension change accordingly. You can click on the centerline number to enter a precise offset. Click once on the sink for a menu to edit the properties, rotate, or delete the sink. If you add a Sink Model, the cutout will look the same, but CounterGo will add a line item for the price of the sink and the price of the cutout in Step 6. Time to add a CooktopCutout. Enter the dimensions, the number of burners and if you’d like to see a centerline for placement. Click and hold on the cutout to reposition. Click once on it for a menu to edit the Properties, or to rotate the cutout. There are lots of places to find Help as you are working, including when you are in the Drawing steps.

Welcome to Materials, Areas & Layout. Log in to your CounterGo database. Start a new Quote or open an existing one. Click on Step 5. You’ll be able to add in all your Materials, Colors, Edges, and pricing into your Price List later, but for now, make a selection from the drop-down menu. Choose a Material, a Color, and an Edge. By default, all your counter pieces will be put into one Area. If you’re quoting more than one area or using multiple materials in one Quote, you can divide the Quote up to show that. Click on “+ Counter Area” to add an additional Area in the Quote. Across from “Area # 2” is a small piece of paper with a pencil icon, the Edit icon. Click on it to rename this area something more meaningful, like “Island”. Look at the small thumbnail drawing for this new Area “Island”. Notice all the pieces are grey. Click on a piece and select to “Make this counter a member of Island” to add it to the Area. Every time you create a new CounterArea, you have to tell CounterGo which pieces belong in that Area. With countertops in different Areas, you can select different Materials, Colors, and Edges. Let’s make a few changes so that the Island is different than the Perimeter counters. We will use a one-time “Other Color” for this area. This feature lets you add a color to this Quote only, it will not add it to your Price List. In the Color drop-down, scroll to the bottom to find “Other Color”. Enter the color Name and the Price per square foot. Even if you are going to be pricing by the slab, you must enter a price per square foot. CounterGo will calculate the cost of the entire slab based on the number you enter. For this counter, I am going to price it by the square foot, so I'll uncheck Priced By The Slab. I'll leave Allow Discount checked in case I want to apply a discount in Step 6. We are ready to lay out our pieces on slabs and add slab images. Click on Perimeter Slab & Layout in the green bar, then check the Show Layout box. CounterGo will estimate how many slabs you need. Notice the pieces are stacked on top of one another. When all the pieces turn green, your layout is good to go. Yellow, Orange, and Red warn you when pieces are overlapping, off the slab, or both. Move counter pieces by clicking and holding your mouse on any piece. Click once on any piece to rotate pieces or define seams. Click on a large piece and select Define Seams. Move your mouse over the counter piece and click to place a seam. If you don’t like the placement, click on the delete icon to the right of that seam to remove it. Position all your pieces so that they are green. If you need to add an additional slab, click +Slab in the lower left corner. Time to add a slab image! Click on the slab dimensions to the right of the layout. This is where you can adjust the size of your slab, delete a slab, or click on Select Image to add an image to this slab. You will need to have slab images saved on your computer or in the cloud before you get to this step. Since your database is empty, click on +ImageFile then Choose to Upload. This will let you step through locations on your computer or cloud to find your image. Select the file then click Save. The green rectangle you see is the proportional representation of your slab. If you click and hold on an edge or corner you can resize the box to eliminate any unwanted areas in the image file. You can also click and hold to reposition the green box on the image. Click Save when you are ready to place the image. The image is placed on the slab and when you move your pieces, it will update in real-time. For the island slab, I’ll use an image I’ve uploaded before. Using the same steps, I’ll click on the slab dimensions, then Select Image, and now I’ll search for the image I used in another Quote since it is already saved in my database. Once you have added images to your database they are always in your database and you can search for them without having to upload them. I can reposition the image in the slab representation if I need to, and now all my pieces have a slab image.

Welcome to Pricing Your Quote. Log in to your CounterGo database. Start a new Quote or open an existing one. Click on Step 5 and be sure you have a Product, Color and Edge selected. If you haven’t made these selections, you won’t be able to edit in Step 6. CounterGo allows you to save all your pricing in PriceLists, but you can start Quoting before you get those set up. Let's manually into this Quote. Move to Step 6. There's a lot of red text indicating missing prices. Click on any underlined text to make changes. I'll click on “no price available” to manually enter a price. If you make a mistake or need to modify a price you enter, click on the underlined black text to update it. If there are line items that you don't charge for, enter zero. If you don’t enter zero CounterGo won’t be able to total your Quote, resulting in a warning that there are prices missing. There may be items you charge for that aren't listed. Let’s add a one-time Miscellaneous item to get one of those into the Quote. To the right of the Area name, you’ll see the Add Icon. Click on the drop-down menu and select Add Miscellaneous Item. This will add an item to this Quote only, it will not add it to the Price List. You'll be able to add miscellaneous items into your Price List later. E the name in Description field, the Quantity, Price and which Area to display the item. If you select one of the Areas already listed in your Quote, the line item will show up with the other ones in that section. If you select “None” this line item will be listed separately with its own heading Other Items. Let’s talk about these checkboxes. Check the first one if you want to include the line item in the price, but hide it on the Quote when it’s printed or emailed to the customer. The second option will allow for this item to be discounted if one is applied. And the third is where you designate if the item is taxable. This Quote is looking good. Let's add a Tax Rate. At the top of the Quote is the Price Settings area. To the right is one of those handy Edit icons. Click on it to Edit Price Settings. From the drop-down menu for Tax Rate, enter a Name, and a percent. The Discount field is where you can apply a Discount to this Quote when using your Price Lists. Anytime you manually enter or edit prices in Step 6, Discounts are not applied. Enter 10 to apply a ten percent discount to any items eligible for a Discount. To the right of each line item that is taxable, there's a letter “T” indicating tax was applied. Click on the “T” to see the details. When Discounts are applied, the letter \"D\" will appear by the line item indicating a Discount has been applied. Click on it to view the details.

Welcome to Quote & Order Forms. Log in to your CounterGo database. From the left-side navigation, click on Settings, Quote & Order, then Forms. You’ll see there are already some default Forms in your database. Let’s update the first one. You’ll need to change each Form individually. To make changes to the existing fields, all you need to do is click in the field to open the Edit Field box. Start with the header field to add your logo and contact information. From the Logo drop-down menu, select New Logo File, then Choose File To Upload. This will let you browse your computer and cloud storage to grab your logo. Under your logo, you can set the height and width. We recommend only setting one to avoid distorting the image. Take a look at the Subheader field, let's add your contact information here. Delete the fake information and enter anything you want to appear at the top of your Form when you print or email it to a customer. Just below the subheader, you can change the font, text color, and background color of the entire header field. It’s easy to reposition your fields. Click and hold on any field to drag it to a new spot. Watch for the two blue arrows with the orange line to show you where the field will be when you release the mouse. The location is based on where your cursor is, not necessarily the edges of the field you’re moving. You can also add additional fields to your Quote Form. The circle with a plus sign is the Add Icon. Whenever you see it in CounterGo you can click to add information. In the Data Type drop-down menu, there are two types of fields you can add, Related info, which will pull information that exists in your Quote or Order, and Formatting which will add fields that can help you customize how your form looks. I want to add the Salesperson field to this form, which is found in Quote/Order Info. From the Name drop-down menu, I see every possible field in this category I can add. When adding fields, they'll appear at the top of the Form, just under the header. I’ll click, hold, and drag the field where I want it to be. Adding in some empty space can make your Form more appealing. Let’s add a static Text Field and leave the text area blank to create some space. I want to remove the border around the field, so I’ll click on it again to edit. Towards the bottom, be sure you’ve selected the Cell tab to set the Border to 0px. Take some time to click around in each field to see what you can change. In the Quote Lines field, you can show or hide the total square footage and slab count, and set how you want your prices to display for the customer in the Show Prices For area. Take a look at the bottom of the Form and make sure the default text reflects how you do business. Need to make a change? Just click in the field and edit the text. We’ve looked at how to add fields, but what about how to remove them? I’m going to take this white space out, so I’ll click on it and then click the Delete icon. You can create new Forms from scratch, but sometimes it’s quicker to copy an existing form. See the small edit icon, by Form Template Info? Click on it to edit this area. Before we copy this Form, this is where we can designate if this Form is to be used for Quotes, Orders or both by making a selection from the Usage drop-down menu. Click the Duplicate icon I’ll name the copy then click Save. Once I make a new copy, CounterGo immediately opens it. I can see all my forms by clicking on Forms in the left-side navigation. There’s my copy at the bottom. If you want to change the order that the Forms appear in drop-down menus when you go to use them, click on any of the underlined numbers in the Sequence column. Click and hold on the double-sided arrow to move a Form up or down in the list. If there are Forms you’re not using, you can inactivate them so they’re no longer an option when printing and emailing. Open the form you want to inactivate and click the Edit icon across from Form Template Info. Underneath Usage, check the box to Inactivate this form.

Welcome to Email Templates. Log in to your CounterGo database. From the left-side navigation, click on Settings, Quote &Order, Email Templates. CounterGo has two kinds of email Templates. My Email Templates are unique to the user login name. For example, I have two CounterGo users in my database myself, and Desmond. If I make a MyEmailTemplate, it will not be available for Desmond to use when he logs in with his unique username and password. Shared Email Templates are visible to any user logged into your database. If I make a Shared Email Template, it will be available for me, and for Desmond to use. Let’s make a Shared Email Template. Click on the Add icon. Your Email Templates will appear as a drop-down menu, when you go to use them. It’s a good idea to name the Template something that gives you an idea of which template it is, or who needs to use it. This name does not show in the email — or on the Quote or Order. I want to make a Template for my Sales team to use, so I’ll name it “Sales Team”. The email entered in the ‘From:” box, shows as the sender when the recipient gets your email. This is also where a reply from them will go. CounterGo can send and track outgoing Quotes and Orders only. Incoming email will go to the email inbox you specify in this area. By default, you’ll see your user name in the “From Name” field. Let’s change that to a person or company name — to look more professional. For the Subject Line and the Body, put in any standard text you don’t want to have to retype. When you go to use the email template, you can still modify the Subject Line and the Body. Make sure you don’t delete this “PDFLink” in brackets. That’s the link for your customers to click on to view their Quotes or Orders. You can add any text above or below it. This looks good, so I’ll save it — and now I have my first Email Template made. If you need to make changes to a Template, click on its name to modify. This is also where you can delete a Template — if you no longer need it. Time to take a look at where these templates are — and how to use them. Open an existing Quote, and from the top menu bar — click on the Email button. The very first menu will list all the Email Templates you’ve made. Right below that — you can select which Quote & Order Form Template to use. If you want a quick preview of how the Quote or Order will look for the customer, click on the Print icon at the top. Enter the email you want to send this Quote or Order to — and any additional text you want to add to the Subject Line or Body. Scroll down below your drawing. CounterGo tracks information like the date and time you sent the email, who you sent it to, how many times the customer has opened it and the most recent date and time they did, along with who sent the email. There may be times when you need to inactivate the link you emailed to a customer. Click on the date and time it was sent, then click the Inactivate button. The Quote link in the email you sent will no longer be active. To reactivate, click on the date and time again then click Activate Link.If you want to send the email again, click on Resend Message. You can also display when Email links to Quotes and Orders are viewed in your QuoteViews. There are lots of places to find Help as you are working.

      "content": "Get Started Video 7: Non-standard Waterfall & Multiple Edges OBJECTIVES Draw Waterfall Edges Select Multiple Edges Assign Multiple Edge Finishes TRANSCRIPT: Hi, this is Amelia from Moraware! Welcome to Waterfall & Multiple Edges. Log in to your CounterGo database. Make a new Quote so you’ll have a copy of what we do in your database. Creating waterfall edges has four parts, draw the pieces, indicate which edges will be mitered, add a second Edge Finish, then apply the Finish to the countertop pieces. In Step 1 draw the countertop, and also the apron pieces that will form the waterfall to the floor. Use this same process even if your pieces won’t go all the way to the floor. I’m going to add text to indicate what these pieces are. With all the counter pieces drawn, it’s time to indicate which of these edges will have a different Edge Finish. Go to Step 3. In this step, we are not indicating which Finish is going to be applied, only that it is not the same on all sides. This edge will touch the floor, so it can be unfinished. This edge will meet up with the top counter, so I’ll choose Additional Finished Edge. I’ll do the same on the main counter. Finished Edge Two is an option since I already applied it on one side of the piece. I’ll indicate what will be the mitered edge on this last piece. You may be wondering why “Finished Edge 2” does not appear in this pop-up. An Additional Finished Edge has not been applied to this piece, so it doesn’t show yet. I’m ready to assign the edge types. Step 5 is where you tell CounterGo exactly which edge finishes will be on each counter. We are going to add the additional Finish type and assign the finishes to the edges of our countertop pieces here. I’ll select a Product, Color, and one of my Edges. Next I’ll click on the Add icon next to Edge to add an additional Finish type. Notice that Edge 1 says it’s being used on 3 counters, but Edge 2, even though we selected “Miter” says “unused”. It’s time to tell CounterGo which finishes belong on which edges. You can work with the thumbnail image as is, or click on the four-sided arrows to make it larger. Starting with this piece on the left, I’ll click on the edge that will be mitered, it shows as “F2” in the drawing, and assign “Miter” to be used on this piece anywhere there is an F2. Even though we assigned “F2” on the previous piece, every counter can have a different finish, so we need to repeat the steps on every piece. Here on the center piece, two edges are marked as “F2”. Once we assign the first “F2” we don’t need to assign the other since they are on the same countertop piece. We’ll assign the miter on this last edge then we are all done. Now CounterGo knows the finished edge “Miter” is used on 3 counters. In Step 6, there are now line items with measurements for both Edge Finishes. Use the same basic steps if you have a countertop that needs different finished edges that are not a waterfall. The main difference is that you do not need to draw the apron pieces. Don’t forget there are lots of places to find Help as you are working, including when you are in the Drawing steps. From the top menu bar, click on the Help icon, then Search Help, to open our Online Help Center in a new window. That covers how to create Quotes with waterfall edges or countertops with multiple edge finishes.

      "content": "Get Started Video 8: Segmented Edges & Splashes OBJECTIVES Create A Minimal Bump-in Segment An Edge Different Splash Heights TRANSCRIPT: Hi, this is Annie from Moraware! Welcome to Segmented Edges & Splashes. Log in to your CounterGo database. Make a new Quote so you’ll have a copy of what we do in your database. Draw a countertop in Step 1. Move to Step 2. This is where we’ll add a Bump-in, then segment the Edge. When you add a Bump-In or Bump-Out to an edge, you can segment that edge to apply different Splashes. So you can apply different splash heights to the same edge. Use this same process if you need to apply different Edge Fnishes to the same edge. Add a Bump-In that has a depth of zero point one. I’m going to enter the dimensions behind a cooktop so it’s Splash can be different than the rest of the countertop. CounterGo always rounds up, so the total square footage will be the same as without the Bump-in. Leave the position set to Center to automatically place it in the center of the countertop. Or offset the Bump-in by selecting Left or Right as the position, then enter the distance from the left or right where the Bump-in should begin. Move to Step 3 and select “Segment This Edge” from the pop-up menu. Now the edge is divided into 3 segments instead of one long one. Let’s give this edge Splashes of different heights. Starting on the left, click on the segment and select a 5-inch Splash. Do the same for the segment on the right. Click on the middle segment and select “Other Splash”. Enter the height for the full height Splash. Go to Step 5 and select your Material, Color and Edge. Under Area Slab & Layout arrange your counter and splash pieces on your slabs. In Step 6 you will see totals for the different Splashes. Don’t forget there are lots of places to find Help as you are working, including when you are in the Drawing steps. From the top menu bar, click on the Help icon, then Search Help, to open our Online Help Center in a new window. Save this Quote to exit the drawing steps. That covers how to segment an edge to create splashes with different heights along the same countertop. The next video, [Pan and Zoom] will go through shortcuts for navigating your drawing canvas.

You’re probably familiar with how to zoom in and out. CounterGo also has a Pan feature, because the drawing space available is much larger than it appears in the view window. Using a combination of these two features can help you navigate drawings that have a lot of pieces. I’ve opened a quote for a big job. With this many countertops, the measurements can get quite small. Using the Zoom In button from the right-side navigation, I can zoom to make changes. And of course, the Zoom Out button will do the opposite. Reset Zoom will switch it back to the original view, fitting all the pieces on the screen. I’ll Zoom back in and change some dimensions on this countertop. When I want to quickly move around to other pieces that are off-screen, I’ll use the Pan button. The larger, light green area is the total drawing area you have available. The smaller dark green rectangle represents the view you can see on the screen at any given time. You can see that the pieces not shown in my zoomed-in view are all in the Pan View. I can click and hold on the small rectangle and move it around to work on different pieces while zoomed in. Click anywhere in the drawing space to close the Pan window and edit a countertop. When you’re done, or if you get too zoomed in, click on Reset Zoom to snap back to showing all the pieces in your drawing. There are lots of places to find Help as you’re working, including when you’re in the Drawing steps. From the top menu bar, click on the Help icon, then Search Help, to open our Online Help Center in a new window. That covers how to use Pan and Zoom to navigate your drawing canvas.

Welcome to CounterGo’s Orders. Log in to your CounterGo database. You might want to pause the video and make a new test Quote to try making an Order. When a Quote sale turns into a real piece of business, you can change that Quote into an Order to track payments received. If you also use Systemize you’ll be able to convert the Order to a Job. Once you convert a Quote to an Order, you can cancel the Order, but it can’t be deleted. I’ll open a Quote that’s ready to go forward. I can convert the Quote to an Order by clicking the Order icon. Orders and Quotes look similar, but Orders have a Payment section. If you didn’t already set Payment Terms, you can enter terms manually now. See our help section for more on creating Default Payment Terms. Click on the Edit icon in the Order Info area. Next, click on the Edit Payment Terms icon. You can set Payment Terms to be either a percent of the total or a fixed amount. I’m going to set this to 50% expected for a deposit and the remaining 50% will be the balance due. When the Order Summary is expanded, the calculated Payment Terms are listed at the bottom. Once I receive a payment I can track that here in the Order. I’ll click on Add Payment across from Payments and enter the amount the customer pays, how they paid, and reference number and notes if needed. Those details show here once the Payment is recorded. Looking at the Order Summary again, the payment is reflected in the total. Payments can’t be deleted, but if you’ve made a mistake entering the payment, open the Payment and you can Void it. Or if you need to refund the payment to the customer, use the Refund icon. If an Order is no longer going forward, you can cancel it by clicking the Edit icon across from Order Info. An Order can be un-canceled by going to the same area of a canceled Order and clicking the Un-Cancel icon. Clicking on Orders from the left side lists all your current Orders, and you can customize these Views to display other information not already shown. For more info on using Orders, click on Help, then Search Help, to open our online Help Center in a new window.

Let’s take a minute to talk about Pricing. A Price List is exactly what it sounds like, a place to store everything that goes into a Quote, and how much you charge. Look at the Retail Price List provided and you’ll see CounterGo has most of the common items already built-in; materials, edges, fab & install, sinks, cutouts, and more. Don’t see items that you charge for? There is a way to add those too. We recommend you start with one Price List, to track all your prices in one place. You’ll need to update each list when you have changes, so using the minimum number will save you time. It’s easy to apply discounts automatically or manually in any Quote or Order if you need to. You can quickly set what items should show on a Quote or Order, which ones can be manually changed, which are allowed to be discounted, and which items are taxable. Check out our other videos for detailed steps to get your Price List set up. And you can always call or email one of our friendly CounterGo experts if you have questions. Thanks for stopping by!",

Ready to add Materials and Colors to a Price List? Adding Materials and Colors for the first time or editing an existing Price List involves the same steps. From the left side, click on Price List, then the name of the Price List to modify. If you're just getting started, use the \"Retail\" Price List, built into your database. We encourage users to start with only one Price List since each one needs to be manually updated. Enter your highest prices and use Discounts when appropriate. Discounts can be applied to individual Accounts to be automatically applied, or they can be added manually when Quoting. Click on the Edit Price List button on the right in order to make changes. You'll see the navigation moves over to the left. And an indicator and the upper corner lets you know, you're making changes to the Price [00:01:00] List. Select Materials, then Add Material. There are two options for adding Material, Built-in, which has some of the most common Materials and Colors preloaded, and Custom. Adding a Custom Material allows you to enter Materials that might not be in that preloaded list. I'll select a Built-in Material. Then counter go we'll fill in the Material Type and a default Slab Size. Type directly into either field to change. Let's take a look at some options you can set. Allow Other Colors lets you add Colors to a specific Quote or Order without adding them to the Price List. Allow Discount will let you apply discounts to this Material when using it in a Quote. Edit Price On Quote means you can manually override the price and an individual Quote. Next is the list of preloaded Colors. Add or delete Colors from this list, and CounterGo will alphabetize the colors as long as they're added one per line. Color's can also be added to the Price List after adding a Material. If the Material is taxable, select the Tax Code \"Tax\". This indicates that the item is taxable. Tax Rates are set for an entire Price List under Settings, in Accounts, or a while Quoting. Click on a Material from the left sub menu, then click Add Colors to add a new Color to an existing Material. Type in names, or copy and paste from a file or spreadsheet, one name per line. To remove a Color click on the delete icon, it looks like a little trashcan, across from a specific Color. Check out the CounterGo Knowledge Base for more [00:03:00] articles and videos.

Click the edit Price List button to make changes. Click on Other Items then Add Other Item. There are two types of Other items you can choose from. An Item of list of items with single fixed prices, like faucets. The second type is a Unit Priced item, something that has a range of fees, like tear-outs. Let’s add one of each type, starting with a Single Price item. Name the Other Item then look at the available options to add. Hide On Quote will include a grey line item for you to see in Step 6, but will not show when printing or emailing your Quote or Order. Always Include this item on Quote will automatically add this line item to every Quote so you don’t forget to add it later Allow Discount Will allow this item to be discounted if a Discount is applied to the Quote Editable Price On Quote means that the price can be manually changed in Step 6. After the item is created, add nested items using the Add Option, then enter prices. Apply a Tax Code applied if necessary. Time to add a unit priced other item. Enter a name, then enter what unit of measure the total price is to be calculated with. I’m adding a tearout fee based on the square footage that must be removed. Unit priced other items have similar additional options, except for including the item on every Quote. Once the item is added, click Add Size to add ranges and prices. I have three rates for tear outs, so I’ll add those. The forst price box “each” refers to a base fee that applies to any number of units. I have a 150 dollar minimum for tearouts, so I’ll enter that for all three. If you don’t need a base fee, enter zero. The second box is the price per unit, in this case, square feet. I charge 40 dollars per square foot for small areas, 30 for tearouts up to 40 square feet, and 15 for anything over 40 square feet. Time to save the Price List and add these new charges to a Quote. Go to Step 6 of a Quote or Order. Click the Add icon next to any area and select from the drop-down list. I’ll add the faucet, choose a model, and leave it in the area I named “kitchen”. Click the Add icon again to add the tear out charge. Enter the total square footage of the tearout and select the area to be “none”. By selecting “none” the item is placed in a separate area.

Hide on Quote will show the line item in gray while you’re working, but will not print on a quote or order. Allow Discount allows for cuts to be discounted if a discount is applied to the Quote. If Editable Price On Quote is checked, in Step 6 the price can be manually changed. A tax code can be chosen from the list of tax codes. Tax codes are created under Quote & Order Settings. Different prices and options can be set for different materials. Click Add Specific Material Price and select either a material type or a specific material, then select options and enter a price. If you have an additional flat fee charge for Waterfall Installation, enable the option from the drop down menu, then enter a price. If Waterfall Installation Charge is not enabled, it will not appear in Step 6. Waterfall Installation Charge has the same options as Mitered Cuts, and can also have different prices for different materials. When a CounterGo Order is converted to a Systemize Job, the imported Order Information includes the total Material needed for the countertop, and the Mitered Cuts total. If you have questions, the CounterGo Knowledge Base has more articles and videos.Or email one of our friendly CounterGo experts at support@moraware.com Thanks for stopping by.",

      "content": "Video: Quote Countertops Without Drawings TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to Quote Countertops Without Drawings. CounterGo has a feature to create Quotes based on measurements or total square footage instead of using a drawing. Quotes can have no drawing at all, or a mix of counters with, and without drawings. Details for counters without drawings can be added at any time during Steps One through Four. Let's start in Step One. From the right side navigation, click the Add Other Counter button. It's optional to name the counter, but when working without drawings, this can be very useful. Select to enter either the total countertop square footage or the measurements. Click Add Size to add more than one piece if needed. Enter the height and length of the Splash by inches or linear feet and the length of the finished Edge. If neither of these measurements are needed, click on the Delete icon to remove. If you need to add more than one Splash or Edge, click the Splash & Edge button and select from the menu. For Edges, you'll select which finished Edge to apply later in Step Five. Curves, Bump-Outs and Bump-ins can be quickly added to the Quote by clicking the Curves & Bump-outs button, and then selecting from the menu. Depending on what selected additional details for radius or dimensions can then be added. Use the Sink & Cutouts button to select Sink models or Cutouts, either those already entered in the Price List, or enter dimensions by selecting the Custom option. When all the information for this counter is entered, click Done. The counter will appear in the right navigation under Add Other Counter. Click on the underlined name to make edits. Click the Add Other Counter button to add additional countertops to this Quote, if needed. Move on to Step Five, to select a Product, Color, and Edge. New countertops without drawings cannot be added in Step Five, but edits can be made by clicking on the underlined counter name. In Step Six, check the pricing. If the Price List has not been filled in yet, click on any red, \"no price available\" to enter manually. Save the Quote, and now it's ready to be emailed or printed. For more information or if you have questions, check out the CounterGo Knowledge Base. Or get in touch with one of our friendly CounterGo experts at support@moraware.com. Thanks for stopping by.",

      "category": "What's New",
      "content": "What’s New: Moraware Recap Fall 2024 TRANSCRIPT: Hi, I'm Chelsea. Wondering what we've been doing behind the screen? Our development team is consistently working to update Moraware Systemize, Inventory, and CounterGo to provide you with the best experience for managing your business. From keeping your system secure, managing larger jobs, and making it easier to use Moraware products, here's a quick recap of just a few of the most recent feature updates. Let's start with an important topic, no matter what Moraware product you use. We've enhanced the security of your database and information with Two Factor Authentication at login. Enabling the feature is not required, but highly recommended since it's the best way to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Systemize Phases are a helpful way to break up larger Jobs and schedule smaller blocks of work separately. When viewing Job Details, the new Phase Filter option allows for selecting and viewing all Activities, Forms, Orders, and uploaded Files related to the Phase or Phases selected. This means less scrolling and easier visibility of only the information you need. For Systemize users who also use Moraware Inventory, recent enhancements allow for Serial Numbers to be searched to find specific slabs easier. Three new features in CounterGo make it easier to quote larger Jobs. Line item only Quotes Without Drawings can now be created. Quotes Without Drawings are helpful to quickly total square footage, especially when a drawing and measurements have already been provided. Square feet, or measurements, along with Curves, Bump outs, Splash, Edge, Sinks, and Cutouts can all quickly be added without creating a Drawing. CounterGo now has the option to create one drawing and then multiply the Quantities of the area in Step 6, making it faster to create multi-unit Quotes that use the same countertop layouts. Page Breaks can now be added to the Drawing Area when printing Quotes, making it easier to read larger or more complex layouts. This feature works best when printed or emailed with a Quote & Order form that has the Drawing Area set to the full width, like the built-in Quote With Large Drawing Form. Additional Countergo improvements were released to make Quoting and Drawing easier and more intuitive. Starting with Pan and Zoom when drawing, keyboard arrow shortcuts have been added when using the Pan feature. Use the Shift key and the mouse to Pan without selecting it from the side menu. Zoom now anchors to the center of the drawing space and works using a magic mouse, mouse with a scroll wheel, two finger touch on a trackpad, or keyboard plus and minus shortcuts. Waterfall and Miters can now be applied to non standard edges.Those that are segmented have bump outs or bump ins, notched or clipped corners. As with standard waterfalls and miters, the amount of Material required, as well as a charge for the two cuts between the pieces, is automatically calculated. The last CounterGo feature to highlight is the ability to add the Total Price as a Display Column in Quote Views. We're pleased to have added these new product features and updates to provide you with an improved Moraware experience. If you have any questions, reach out to our friendly Moraware Support Team at support@moraware.com.Thanks for stopping by!",

Other shapes can be broken into smaller shapes instead of being drawn as one continuous piece. This will allow you to arrive at a useful price for your Quote. In some cases, it's preferable to print the Quote without the Drawing. In general, non-standard shapes are approximated and their areas are totaled. CounterGo will always round up, so your Quote should not be short when it comes to estimated material, it should calculate slightly larger. Our friendly CounterGo experts are also happy to help think through the best approach for non-standard shapes. For help, send an email with a picture of what you are trying to recreate to support@moraware.com. Not every shape can be translated to CounterGo, but our team has seen many unique counters over the years and can offer suggestions when applicable.",

      "content": "Understand Multiple Edges Understanding how to assign multiple edges to a countertop can be confusing at first. Multiple edges are created in Step 3 AND Step 5. In Step 3 you are telling the system if an edge has a finish style or does not, regardless of which edge style you will later choose. A finished edge is designated by the letter \"F\" and/or a number after it. An edge without a finished edge style is either Appliance or Unfinished. In Step 5 you tell the system which edge style to apply to each edge, regardless of the abbreviation in Step 3. Each time you click on an edge in Step 3, if that edge finish will be different from the other edges on that countertop, select Additional Finished Edge from the pop-up menu. In the example below, there are edges with and without a finish style on the L-shaped counter and each edge of the island has a different edge style. That totals of 6 possible edges for the entire Quote. Move to Step 5 and select to use 6 different edge styles by clicking Add Edge. Next, the edge styles will need to be assigned to each countertop. What you assign as \"F1\" on one counter is not automatically assigned to the same \"F1\" on another piece. Think of each countertop as unique. Click on the counter in the thumbnail and decide which edge style to assign to each different edge. In this example, the L-shaped counter is assigned first two edge styles on the list. Because there are 4 different edges for the island selected in Step 3 (F1-F4), there are 4 edge styles to assign in Step 5. You can use any of the 6 edge styles you previously added, each one is listed. Note: Once you have assigned each edge style to a Finished Edge, the list in Step 5 will show that each edge style has a counter(s) where it is used. if you see an edge style with \"unused\" next to the name, it has not been assigned. To assign them, just click on the thumbnail drawing and select that edge style from the list of options.",

You can experiment with the size of the clip to make it look right, or you can use Pythagorean Theorem to get the right length for the triangle you want to make. The square footage is determined by the original square or rectangle, indicated by the grey measurement arrows. In Step 1 Counter Dimensions, draw a square. Go to Step 2 Curves & Bumpouts.

And how to enter your prices in the Price List? Prices for Mitered Cuts and Waterfall Installation can be added to the Price List, or manually entered in Step 6. Waterfall Material pricing is calculated based on the price of the Material selected in Step 5. Material pieces will be created and shown in Area & Slab Layout in Step 5. The total Linear Feet of the Mitered Cuts in Step 6 includes the edge between adjacent Mitered Cuts and Waterfalls. If you only charge for one cut, enter half the amount for Mitered Cuts in the Price List. For example, if you charge $40 per linear foot for only one cut, enter $20 for Mitered cuts in the Price List. If you charge for both cuts, then enter the full price, $40 in this example, for Mitered Cuts in the Price List. The Mitered Edge feature adds up the linear feet for the Mitered Cuts on all pieces and the shortest edge of any adjacent pieces. When a CounterGo Order is converted to a Systemize Job, the imported Order Information includes the total Material needed for the countertop, and the Mitered Cuts total.",

      "content": "How Square Footage Is Calculated Not sure if you should draw an L-shape or use a Bump-out? How a countertop is drawn can impact how square footage is calculated. There are several different ways the same shapes can be created. Most of the time, the simplest way to draw a counter is best. What goes on behind the scenes in CounterGo is fairly complex, so the most direct way to describe how square footage is calculated is to say that shapes are approximated and totaled. The gray arrows may seem to be indicating the area being calculated, but they represent the length of the edge of the original shape drawn, which is not always the same as the dimensions of the final shape after angles, curves, clips, bump-outs, or bump-ins are applied. Pricing by the Slab is a good way to make sure you don't under bid. And using the Slab Layout feature in Step 5 allows you to visualize what will fit on each slab. The example below will show you an L-shaped counter drawn two ways, as a continuous shape or as a Bump-out. More complex shapes have their area calculated by approximating the shape with smaller shapes and overlaps. CounterGo will always default to rounding that total up, not down, so you will not underestimate when Quoting. The counter on the left was drawn as an L-shape in Step 1. The counter on the right was drawn as a rectangle in Step 1, then a Bump-out was added during Step 2. The grey arrows showing the edge measurements vary between the two. On the counter on the left, the square footage calculated by the rectangles inside the L-shape, shown in red. On the right side counter, the area is calculated by the larger blue box that surrounds the entire counter. The square feet calculated for the Material, Fabrication & Installation charges are different in Step 6. There is also a line item for the Bump-out for the counter on the right.",

      "content": "Quote Commercial Jobs Though CounterGo is not designed for commercial jobs, they can be quoted. If you send your CounterGo Orders to Systemize, or export your Orders to Quickbooks, we suggest scheduling a support call to talk over your process before following the directions below. Email us at support@moraware.com to set up a time to talk. When estimating commercial work, there are three steps to keep in mind: This method relies on pricing by the square foot, so calculate your square foot pricing. Draw and calculate the price for one counter or counter set. Adjust for tax. Pricing commercial jobs correctly is more complicated than pricing a residential job - so do your own due diligence before using this technique. Feel free to ask us for help if you have questions. CALCULATE PRICE AND ZERO WASTEWhen using this method to calculate commercial jobs, it is necessary to calculate pricing by the square foot, even if you normally price by the slab. Calculate the price you want to charge per square foot for your job. If you normally charge by the slab. The spreadsheet below can help you determine the square foot price for the commercial job. Calculate-zero-waste-sq-ft-price.xlsx Calculate-zero-waste-meter-price.xlsx CREATE THE QUOTEBasically, we will create and price a single room, then multiply by the number of rooms that will be in the job. Create a new Quote and draw the counter shapes in Step 1. For this example, let's make two counters with a simple splash and a sink. Proceed through the Steps 1-5 as you would for a regular quote. In Step 5, select Material, Color, and Edge.. Move to Step 6 and apply a tax rate as you normally would. In this example, only the physical items are taxed, your tax rules may be slightly different. Now you have the cost of one room including tax. Before adding an Other Item to multiply by the remaining rooms, tax needs to be added as a line item, then removed from the overall quote, otherwise, the tax would be applied incorrectly. Add an Other Item in the area for Single Apartment called \"Sales Tax on Goods\". Make sure the Other Item is NOT taxable. Edit your Price Settings to remove Tax Rate from the Quote. Now it's time to add an Other Item for the remaining rooms of the job called \"Additional Apartments 2-20\". Use the Subtotal price from Single Apartment and enter the remaining number of rooms. This practice quote is for an apartment complex with 80 rooms, so 79 additional rooms are needed. Make sure the Other Item is NOT taxable. MULTIPLE LAYOUTS WITH MULTIPLE ROOMSEven if you have more than one layout type, and multiple rooms per that layout, use the same approach. Create all layouts in Step 1. Assign each Layout its own Area in Step 5. Use the same approach as above to calculate the cost per area, adding a line item for tax for each area.",

Just like Quotes, they have a Summary area and can be printed or emailed using customizable Order Forms. You can create and customize Views for your Orders the same way you create Quote Views. You'll notice some new columns in Orders Views to show summary information like Sale Date, Total Price, and total Square Feet. If you also use Systemize, you can create a Job from an Order and automatically pull in relevant details from the Quote without having to re-enter information. You can quickly see total Price, Square Feet, Material & Color, Splash, Edge and Sinks.",

We can show you where to enter the taxes you have to collect in our software, but we can't advise you on what gets taxed, how much, or even which tax to charge, consult your Accountant or other tax professional. When setting up CounterGo, you can think of taxes in two parts, naming the tax you collect and entering how much that tax is in the areas where you do business. Tax Codes are where you name the tax you have to collect. Tax Rates are where you enter a particular county, city, state, province, or region and a numeric value for how much that tax is. If you live in the US, you probably won't need to adjust your Tax Code, your database came with one called \"Tax\" built in. If you live outside the US and have to collect HST, GST, VAT, etc., you enter those in Tax Codes. Regardless of where you live and how many Tax Codes you have, you will need to create and enter the numerical values for each area you collect taxes in by going to Settings > Quote & Order > Tax Rates. Once entered you can assign default rates to Price Lists or Accounts, or manually make selections in Step 6. International Example US Example",

      "content": "Change Login Location Settings In CounterGo Intended to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, Login Locations are based on IP Addresses. When set up incorrectly, it can prevent your entire organization from accessing your data. We highly recommended that only the person responsible for IT infrastructure manage location-based security if you need to use it. The User option \"Login from anywhere\" overrides a user being included in a Login Location restriction. For example, if a User named 'Buddy' is added to a Login Location called 'Office Only', and Buddy's User account has Login from anywhere checked, Buddy can still log in from anywhere, regardless of being included in the Login Location list. Edit the User Buddy and uncheck Login from anywhere. Considerations before setting up Login Locations: If your office does not have a static IP address, meaning it can change, it is very dangerous and unwise to use location-based security. If a location of 'Office Only' is defined and properly implemented, only users who log in from your office network will be allowed access. Mobile devices, home access, coffee shop access will all be denied, UNLESS a VPN (virtual private network) is set up so remote users can securely connect to the office network, then connect to Moraware. Identify which users should be restricted to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. Login Location is driven off of IP addresses ranges. Users must be selected for Login Location rules to apply - an empty list of Users means NO users fall under the location restrictions. Go to Settings > System > Login Locations and click + Create at the top of the page. Name the location and click the Multiple icon to select the Users restricted to this Login Location rule. Enter a single IP address or a range and Save. Go to Settings > Users & Roles > Users For each User on the list of restricted Login Locations, confirm restrictions are in effect by inspecting the Login From column in the User list.",

Open Safari and enter the URL for your Moraware site. Touch the Share icon at the bottom of the screen. Select Add to Home Screen. Select a name for your new shortcut that will be displayed with the Moraware logo, then Add. Now just tap the new shortcut on your home screen, and it will open the website in its own window, independent of Safari.",

Include or exclude CounterGo Payments. Map CounterGo Price List items, Tax information to QuickBooks. One way communication from CounterGo to QuickBooks. Quick Books Online Simple Start, Freelancer/Self Employed and QuickBooks Desktop for Mac are not supported. If you are not a CounterGo user yet, visit moraware.com/pricing to schedule a demo. TRANSCRIPT: Hi, This is Evan from Moraware. Let’s talk about CounterGo’s QuickBooks Integration feature and if it is a good fit for your business. As you know, using CounterGo dramatically increases how quickly you can create and send professional looking Quotes. When a customer decides to go forward with your Quote, turn it into an Order, and track Payment terms and transactions, to keep well organized. If you keep your finances organized in Quickbooks, you have the option to export information from CounterGo via the QuickBooks Integration feature. CounterGo Orders can be exported to QuickBooks Online or Desktop, as Invoices or Estimates, with just a few clicks. You do need to be using Orders in CounterGo to take advantage of the QuickBooks Integration. Quotes can’t be exported to QuickBooks, only Orders. You have full control over which Orders get exported too. Setting up QuickBooks Integration does not automatically export all Orders. You decide which Orders get exported and when. If you are currently tracking financial transactions in CounterGo, you can select to export Payments along with the Order. If you track all financial transactions in QuickBooks, you can turn off the option to export CounterGo Payments. You can map customers to existing customers already in QuickBooks, or create new ones directly from the CounterGo Order at export. If you collect another Payment in CounterGo or change an Order after it’s been exported, CounterGo will remind you that it needs your attention, and exporting the updated Order to QuickBooks only takes a couple clicks. Updates from CounterGo to QuickBooks are “one way”. That means if changes are made to an Order in CounterGo, those can be updated in QuickBooks, but if changes are made in QuickBooks, that information is not sent back to CounterGo. The QuickBooks Export Status can be added to Order Views to see at a glance the status of any Order in the View. A full Export Status page lists each Order exported along with the time and date. CounterGo steps you through mapping taxes and items in your Price LIst into QuickBooks products and services. The mapping for products and services is not as detailed in QuickBooks as it is in CounterGo, most CounterGo Price List items are mapped into QuickBooks categories like material, labor and sales. If you use custom transaction numbers in QuickBooks, those need to be disabled in order to export from CounterGo. Not sure if using the QuickBooks Integration is right for how you do business? Send us an email or give us a call, we’re happy to talk details. Thanks for stopping by!",

      "content": "QuickBooks Integration Overview Curious about CounterGo's QuickBooks Integration? CounterGo Orders and Payment information can be exported into QuickBooks. This communication is one way, meaning information is sent from CounterGo to QuickBooks, nothing is sent from QuickBooks back to CounterGo. You have full control of which Orders get exported and when, Orders are not automatically exported. Once CounterGo Orders are exported to either QuickBooks Invoices or Estimates, or if Payments are tracked in CounterGo, they can be updated if the Order changes. You can customize your CounterGo Views to keep track of what has and has not been exported, or what may need updating. CounterGo will walk you through each step to integrate with QuickBooks. Some basics are outlined below, If you'd like to talk details, email support@moraware.com. If you are not a CounterGo user yet, visit moraware.com/pricing to schedule a demo. CounterGo Orders: Only Orders, not Quotes, can be exported to QuickBooks. If you have not already started using Orders, add it to your workflow before integrating with QuickBooks. QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Desktop: You can use either version of QuickBooks with CounterGo if you use a PC. Because CounterGo is web-based, if you use QuickBooks Desktop you'll need to also use the Web Connector that QuickBooks developed. The QuickBooks Web Connector does not support QuickBooks Desktop for Mac, so Mac users can use the Online version only for CounterGo integration. QuickBooks Online Simple Start and Freelancer/Self Employed are not compatible with the QuickBooks Integration. Custom Transaction Numbers: Custom Transaction Numbers in QuickBooks Online will need to be disabled to use CounterGo's QuickBooks Integration. QuickBooks Invoice or Estimate: CounterGo Orders can be exported to either QuickBooks Invoices or Estimates. Payments can not be attached to Estimates, CounterGo Payments can only be exported to Invoices. If you set up to export to Estimates and want to change and export Invoices, or vice versa, the settings can be edited. Payments: If you track Payments in CounterGo, those can be exported to QuickBooks Invoices, and updated if additional CounterGo Payments are recorded after the initial export. Exports are one way communication, if you record transactions in QuickBooks, they will not be reflected in CounterGo. It's best to track payments in CounterGo or QuickBooks, but not both. Tax: Before you begin, be sure you have set up your Tax Rates and Tax Codes in CounterGo the same as in QuickBooks. You will be prompted to map your CounterGo Tax to QuickBooks. We can show you where to enter the taxes you have to collect in our software, but we can't advise you on what gets taxed, how much, or even which tax to charge. Consult your Accountant or other tax professional. Item Mapping: Mapping items to QuickBooks will not have the same level of detail as your CounterGo Price List. Be sure you have your products and services defined in QuickBooks before you begin mapping in CounterGo. We recommend mapping your Price List items into general categories, like Material, Labor, Sales, etc. Views: After integrating QuickBooks, add the QuickBooks Export field to any View for a quick way to track if an Order has been exported to QuickBooks and the current status.",

As you complete each step, the color of that step changes form orange to green. If you need help or have questions, email one of our friendly CounterGo experts at support@moraware.com. You will need to have either a QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Desktop for PC account set up before you begin. QuickBooks Online Simple Start and Freelancer/Self Employed are not compatible with the integration feature. Only Orders can be exported to QuickBooks, not Quotes. Start using Orders in your workflow before you set up the Integration. Once the QuickBooks Integration is set up, you have full control over which Orders get exported and when, they are not automatically sent over. We can show you how CounterGo integrates with QuickBooks, but we can't advise you on best practices for QuickBooks, financials or taxes. Go to Settings > QuickBooks Export > Setup and select which version of QuickBooks you use, Online or Desktop. Select if you want your CounterGo Orders to become QuickBooks Invoices or Estimates, then select if you want Payments recorded in CounterGo to be exported as well. Connect to you QuickBooks account. You'll be prompted to login to your QuickBooks account with your user name and password for QuickBooks. Once you link CounterGo to a QuickBooks account you will need to contact us if you need to change to a different QuickBooks account. If you are using QuickBooks Desktop for PC, you will be prompted to download and run the QuickBooks Web Connector. You will need to have your CounterGo Tax set up the same as in QuickBooks. Confirm the Tax Mapping. This step may happen automatically if your taxes are set up the same in both CounterGo and QuickBooks. Map your CounterGo Price List Items to QuickBooks and you 're almost done. This step will take a few minutes to map each item. Items can be skipped in this step and you will be prompted to map them when they are used in an Order. Set the Format for your Exports to determine the level of detail shown in the QuickBooks Invoice or Estimate.",
